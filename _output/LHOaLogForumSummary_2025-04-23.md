1. **Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors:**
   - **Discontinuity in the Coax Cable for ASC REFL B 9MHz channel:** A reported issue involves a discontinuity detected in the coax cable at the feedthrough, affecting the ASC REFL B 9MHz channel. This means the signal is seen passing through a part of the cable but stops at the feedthrough point, which could be due to issues in the cable itself or its connection at the feedthrough. This interruption in continuity could affect the reliability of the signals received from this sensor. [More details](https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84065)

2. **Alterations to Particular Sensors:**
   - **PSL Picomotor Functionality Restoration:** The Pre-Stabilized Laser (PSL) picomotors were restored to functionality by moving them to a new driver. This is important because the picomotors help in aligning the laser which is critical for the accurate measurement of gravitational waves. After moving to the new driver, alignment adjustments were made to the PMC and RefCav, which had shown significant misalignments.

   - **Change in Logic for PSL PMC and FSS Channels:** There was an alteration in the logic used for several Pre-Stabilized Laser Power and Frequency Stabilization System channels. This change affects how the data should be interpreted; specifically, the "non-zero" states now have a defined value which could differ from previous settings. This alteration is crucial for those tracking system status through these channels, as it adjusts how the on and off states are reported.
