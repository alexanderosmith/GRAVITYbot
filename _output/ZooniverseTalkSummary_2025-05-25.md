1. **New Glitch Classes Proposed This Week:**
   - **Rain Clouds:** This week introduces "rain clouds" as a new potential glitch classification, described as originating from momentary slight misalignments of the squeezer subsystem which impacts the suppression of quantum noise at higher frequencies.

2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**
   - There is an ongoing discussion about the ambiguity in classifying some glitches either as "Koi Fish" or other types due to overlapping characteristics like "lighthouse traits." This confusion persists as users try to reconcile observed data with existing glitch classes.

3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**
   - A user questions if a glitch that appears as an "exclamation mark" should be classified under "None of the Above" (NOTA) or if it represents a new type, indicating curiosity about how to categorize unusual patterns not fitting conventional descriptions.
