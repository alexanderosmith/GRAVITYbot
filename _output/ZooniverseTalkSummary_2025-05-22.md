1. **New Glitch Class Proposals:**
   - **"Pirate Ship" Glitch**: This week, citizen scientists identified a new glitch class resembling a "pirate ship". This glitch is notable for its distinct shape and was initially confusing due to its unique waveform characteristics. The discussion around this glitch shows the continuous refinement and expansion of glitch categories by the contributors.
