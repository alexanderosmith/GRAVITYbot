1. **Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors:**
   - **Intermittent Connection on Pin of the DB at the SatAmp End**: There was a problem with an intermittent connection on a pin at the Satellite Amplifier end, which affects the response of the sensors connected through this connection. This connection issue could cause unexpected behavior in the data collected, potentially introducing noise or glitches. [76675](https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=76675)
   - **Faulty Coaxial Cable Affecting ASC REFL B WFS**: A coaxial cable was found to have defects which affected the response from one of the Wave Front Sensors. This could lead to inaccurate readings or glitches in the gravitational wave data. [76685](https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=76685)

2. **Alterations to Particular Sensors:**
   - **Cable Replacement for D CPS Triax G-1G**: A cable was ejected from its port due to insufficient torque, and subsequently, a replacement and re-torquing were necessary. Such alterations can cause temporary instability or calibration errors in the sensors connected by this cable. [76684](https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=76684)
   - **Swapping and Reconnecting of Cables in the HAM ISI**: Cables were moved and reconnected as part of troubleshooting sensor connections. This includes the handling of various cables affecting the REFL and POP sensors. Adjustments and replacements can impact the sensors' performance until they are properly recalibrated.

3. **External Events Potentially Related to Glitches:**
   - **High Logging Noise**: The observatory recorded high logging noise during a summary which can interfere with the sensitive measurements required for detecting gravitational waves. This environmental noise is an external factor that could contribute to data glitches. [76671](https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=76671)
   - **PSI Cleanroom HEPA Pre-filter Change**: The replacement of the HEPA pre-filter in the PSI Cleanroom at both Y and X Ends was completed. Although this is a routine maintenance task, any work in sensitive areas can introduce temporary disturbances that might be reflected as glitches in the gravitational wave data.

   - **Microseism Activity Increase**: An increase in microseismic activity (small vibrations of the earth) was noted, which is known to affect the sensitive instruments used in LIGO. Such natural variations can lead to anomalies in the detected signals. [76662](https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=76662)
