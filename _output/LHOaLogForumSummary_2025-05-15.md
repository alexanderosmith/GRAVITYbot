1. **Unresolved issues related to sensors that may cause glitches in gravitational wave data:**
   - **Beam Dump Misalignment:** There were issues with the placement of beam dumps, which are designed to safely absorb or block stray laser beams to prevent unintended reflections or paths that can interfere with detections. Misalignment could cause unexpected scattering or reflections, affecting data quality. [84376](https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84376)
   
2. **Alterations to particular sensors:**
   - **Gold Plated Wire Loop Replacement:** Betsy and Ibrahim replaced a non-plated bottom wire loop with a gold plated wire loop on the Blade Spring System (BBSS). This was done to potentially improve the system but the new wire resulted in no significant differences, suggesting unresolved variables in the system's performance.

   - **Beckhoff Automation Code Adjustments:** There were adjustments to the Beckhoff automation code which manages certain sensor data. These changes were made to help improve the reliability of the Automatic Length Sensing and Control System (ALS) locking system, which had been showing unreliability. The adjustment involved relaxing some thresholds that could potentially affect how sensor errors are handled and logged. [84387](https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84387)

3. **External events not related to sensor failures or modifications that might relate to glitches in gravitational wave data:**
   - **Wind and Weather Conditions:** On several occasions, wind speeds were high enough to affect scheduled maintenance and installation activities, such as the wind fence work. High winds can cause vibrations or movements that might be picked up by sensitive equipment, potentially resulting in data anomalies.

   - **Beehive Presence:** A beehive near the LIGO facility posed a unique challenge as vibrations or swarms could potentially affect sensitive instruments. The beehive had to be relocated, which was a delicate operation given the proximity to sensitive areas. [84396](https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84396)
