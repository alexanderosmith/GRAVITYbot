### 3. Hypotheses on Glitch Origins

#### 3.1 Scattered Light due to ground motion
   - **Hypothesis**: The new subclass of "Scattered Light" glitches is hypothesized to be caused by ground motion.
   - **Rationale**: It is suggested that ground motion in the Hz region creates arches in the data, which are seen as glitches. This hypothesis is based on observed data patterns following ground motion events.
