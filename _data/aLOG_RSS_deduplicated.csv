275,H1 General - Ops Eve Shift End,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=80338,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Fri, 27 Sep 2024 22:09:44 -0700","TITLE: 09/28 Eve Shift: 2330-0500 UTC (1630-2200 PST) all times posted in UTC STATE of H1: Lock Acquisition INCOMING OPERATOR: Ryan C SHIFT SUMMARY: Currently relocking and at ACQUIRE_DRMI_1F. We were cleared to go into Observing by the CAL team 45 minutes ago when we were still Locked and got in 10 minutes of Observation time before losing lock from an FSS oscillation . Before that troubleshooting was being done by the calibration team for the entirety of my shift so I had just been trying to keep us locked and by running broadband measurements when they needed them. Current status of the calibration work is that they tried multiple things with ultimately no success. The things they tried have been reverted and they will be writing up their own alog and continuing work on Monday. While trying to relock after the first lockloss of my shift and this last lockloss we got stuck in READY due to IMC_LOCK being in FAULT with the DIAG_MAIN messages: "" PSL_FSS: PZT MON is high may be oscillating "" and "" PSL_FSS_TPD: RefCav transmission low fix alignment "". I tried taking the IMC to DOWN and then back to LOCKED and tried toggling the FSS loop automation OFF and then back ON but neither seemed to help. But both times the IMC was eventually able to lock but I'm not sure that it had anything to do with my toggling. Once the IMC was locked relocking went smoothly for that first relock and so far is going well this relock. So the FSS oscillations are not only causing locklosses but now are also starting to delay relocking.

Specifically I used a 21 Hz - 25 Hz blrms of auxiliary channels (CS/EX/EY HPIISIPEM & SUS channels) to try and model a strain blrms of the same frequency via lasso. In the pdf attached the first slide shows the fit from running lasso. The r^2 value was pretty low but the lasso fit does pick up some peaks in the auxiliary channels that do line up with the strain noise. In the following slides I made time series plots of the channels that lasso found to be contributing the most to the re-creation of the strain. The results are a bit hard to interpret though. There seems to be roughly 5 peaks in the aux channel blrms but only 2 major ones in the strain blrms. The top contributing aux channels are also not really from one area so I can't say that this narrowed down a potential location. However two HAM8 channels were among the top contributors (H1:ISI_HAM8_BLND_GS_X/Y). It is hard to say if that is significant or not since I am only looking at about an hours worth of data. I did a rough check on the summary pages to see if this noise happened on more than one day but at this moment I didn't find other days with this behavior. If I do come across it happening again (or if someone else notices it) I can run lasso again.

I was only able to get a small improvement by walking the steering mirrors into the pump fiber and also a small decrease in the rejected polarization in HAM7 by walking the half wave plate and quarter wave plate in the pump fiber path. The attached trend shows that since the OFI ventthe green power reflected from the OPO in both polarizations has been steadily increasing while the transmitted power has been constant which means that the launched power has had to increase. This indicates that we should try to move the OPO crystal soon.

After trying a couple of controllers it was clear that the pump broke down.Shortly after the maintenance period because of the high seismic activity locking was impossible so the vacuum team took the opportunity and swapped the pump (as normally it would have been impossible during the 4 hours of the maintenance period).The AIP was swapped with a noble diode pump - this was not exactly intentional but turned out to be a happy accident as it seemingly works much better than the Starcell or even the Galaxy pumps. However as the noble diode pump has positive polarity a positive polarity controller was needed: the only available piece is an Agilent IPC Mini (see it in the picture attached) which works well but in the MEDM screen it appears to be faulty due to its wiring differences.All in all the HAM1/HAM2 twin-annulus system was pumped with the 2 AIPs and an Aux cart - Turbo pump bundle. The noble diode pump stabilized very nicely (at 5-7E-7 Torr which is unusually low) so eventually the Aux cart Turbo pump bundle was switched off - at 6:55 pm PT.Since then the 2 AIPs continue to decrease the annulus pressure which is indeed very nice so practically we are back to normal.In the meantime Gerardo quickly modified an appropriate Varian controller to have positive polarity so at the next opportunity the vacuum team will swap it with the Agilent controller so the MEDM screen will also be normal. Note that the Aux cart - Turbo bundle remain there until this swap happens. ,"{'term': 'LHO VE', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80411,janos.csizmazia@ligo.org

Oberling R. Short M. Pirello F. Clara F. Mera Summary : We're pretty much back where we started not sure where the problem is but sure there is a problem somewhere. Since mid-September there have been an increasing number of glitches in the FSS. These are seen in the FAST channel (signal to NPRO PZT) the PC channel (signal to phase-correcting EOM) and the TEMP channel (NPRO crystal operating temperature). In addition these glitches are the suspected cause of many locklosses in the last couple of weeks and have delayed relocking due to these glitches causing FSS oscillations. In light of this we took a look at the FSS today. At the start of maintenance we unlocked the IMC leaving the FSS locked to only the Reference Cavity (RefCav). I tweaked up the alignment then went out on the floor with Fernando and Ryan to take a look at the FSS transfer function. I set up the Agilent network analyzer as normal but the TF looked like garbage I had to up the source power to 0 dBm (from our usual -20 dBm) to get a clear signal and still the TF looked wrong. See first attachment. Seeing this we filed a WP ( 12114 ) and pulled the TTFSS box from the PSL enclosure and took it to the EE shop. The current TTFSS is old and we were unable to find a test plan for it. With Marc Fil and Fernando we began stepping through the circuit diagram testing each component to make sure it was functioning as expected from the diagram (for example: ""The gain should be x is it? No but we might be injecting too high a frequency see the filter in the feedback? Lower the frequency now is the gain OK? Yes.""). This was somewhat time consuming but we could find no single component that was clearly bad or not operating properly. Visually everything looked ok nothing was obviously blown or damaged. Marc did clean some excess flux from some of the solder pads. We then checked the LO and everything looked OK there as well signal amplitude might be a little high but Fil didn't see anything worrisome. Not knowing what else to do I reinstalled the TTFSS box. Once the box was installed I took a TF this time from inside the enclosure using the Agilent unit we keep in there. The TF looked just fine and as expected see 2nd attachment. With a common gain of 15 and a fast gain of 9 the FSS has a UGF of 452 kHz with 65° of phase margin the peaks around 770 kHz are still present like normal. We decided to check the crossover (where the NPRO PZT and the phase-correcting EOM meet) at ~20 kHz (this is set with the fast gain). The 3rd attachment shows the crossover as found with a fast gain of 9. We tried raising the fast gain but this made the crossover peak larger. Lowering the fast gain made the peak smaller but also starts to raise the overall signal (see 4th and 5th attachments with a fast gain of 7 and 6 respectively). We decided to leave the fast gain at 7 for now will see how things behave (in the 3 hours since we made this change and the time of writing this alog behavior seems unchanged). The picture with the fast gain at 7 does looke a little worse than the intial one with fast gain at 9 not sure why we went back and forth between them a couple times and 9 looked worse than 7 each time (maybe I got ""lucky"" with the camera shot?). This done we transitioned the enclosure back to Science Mode. Before leaving the LVEA we tried one more thing. Since we had a successful TF measurement inside the enclosure we hooked up the Agilent unit by the PSL/ISC racks again and took a TF (since I had an apparent junk measurement with this same unit earlier in the day see that 1st attachment again). The TF looked perfectly fine matched the measurement done inside the enclosure. Not sure where the garbage TF from this morning came from at this point I can only call it ""user error of unknown origin."" So we've ended where we started sure there's a problem but not sure where it is. The current TTFSS appears to be operating correctly but the FAST signal is still glitching we even saw glitching with the IMC unlocked although Ryan reports that it ""seems"" like the glitching is more frequent when the IMC is locked (maybe IFO feedback is exacerbating an existing issue...). Marc and Fil have been testing a newer gen of TTFSS (not the same as used in SQZ as that one is not compatible with the PSL as currently wired) so once that is qualified we will try switching to it (Peter King had it working with the RefCav in the optics lab so it should work with the PSL). We'll try that next. ","{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80409,jason.oberling@ligo.org

The error reported over the weekend using the PCAL monitoring lines suggests that LHO is well within the 10% magnitude & 10 degree error window after about 15 minutes into each lock ( attached image ). Here is a link to the 'monitoring line' grafana page that we often look at to keep track of the PCALY/GDS_CALIB_STRAIN response at the monitoring line frequencies. The link covers Saturday to today. This still suggests the presence of calibration error near 33Hz that is not currently understood but as mentioned earlier it's now well within the 10%/10deg window. We think that the SRCL offset adjustment in LHO:80334 and LHO:80331 accounts for the largest contribution to the improvement of the calibration at LHO in the past week. -- What's Been Tried --No attempts by CAL (me JoeB Vlad) to correct the 33Hz error have been successful. Many things were tried throughout the week (mostly on Tuesday & Friday) that went without being properly logged. Here's a non-exhaustive list of checks we've tried (in no particular order): We cross-checked every single front end filter and gain parameter in the pyDARM model file against what's installed at LHO. Other than non-impacting foton file changes (e.g. out-of-path module changes) the only mismatch we identified is that the bias voltage in pyDARM was set to 3.3 instead of the IFO's 3.25 . We quickly implemented SRC detuning by copying the LLO setup. I did this by making on-the-fly changes to pyDARM on a local copy of the repo. I'll have to follow up with what these exact adjustments entailed. This seemed to do what we expected but it did not significantly impact the large 33Hz error. Some GDS pipeline-affecting parameters made their way into the pydarm ini at LHO. These changes were made around the time of the Cal F2F over the summer. I reverted them regenerated GSTLAL filters and installed them in the GDS pipeline. This didn't help. The commits in question are d2bfe349 8717a9f5 and dc7208e0 . We don't believe the delays being reported by the pyDARM fits of the actuation delay on the PUM stage. We made adjustments to the fitting parameters for this stage to increase the fit range to roughly 400Hz in the hopes that pyDARM would produce a somewhat believable number. More details on this item as time allows we are going to tune our injections to reduce uncertainty on these measurements in particular. This tuning will need to be done in tandem with other tunings (e.g. reducing PCAL at low frequencies to avoid leakage from polluting simultaneous higher frequency measurements). We made similar adjustments to the sensing fit parameters. We extended the low end of the fit range to better capture the detuning near 10Hz in the fit. Once it approached midnight on Friday night we reverted everything and left the IFO back in the state we found it in. This process is also not straightforward and requires creating a new 'fake' pyDARM report each time due recently-discovered bugs in the pyDARM infrastructure. This bug is being tracked here . --What Changed?--We think the SRC change(s) on September 5 ( LHO:79929 also discussed in LHO:79903 ) line up well with the time frame at which the 33Hz error issue popped up. Here is a screenshot showing that the 33Hz error showed up on September 5. I've also attached a shot of ndscope showing the SRCL offset change on 09/05 from -175cts to -290cts here . cal_better_after_srcl_changed.png shows the error tracked by the monitoring lines before and after the SRCL offset was changed back to -190cts.

If they are it requests them to unlock and relock. This is to force them into a better place before we go into observing. I've added PMC to the PZT_checker will relock if it's outside of 15-85V. Full range is 0-100V. SQZ_MANAGER reloaded. Plan to take GRD though DOWN and back to FDS. ,"{'term': 'H1 SQZ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80371,camilla.compton@ligo.org

This has happened several times before where Guardian is usually successful in bringing things back and H1 returns to observing within minutes so I'm not convinced this is the cause of the lockloss. However when looking at Guardian logs around this time I noticed one of the first things that could indicate a cause for a lockloss was from the IMC_LOCK Guardian where at 04:54:00 UTC it reported ""1st loop is saturated"" and opened the ISS second loop. While this process was happening over the course of several milliseconds the lockloss occurred. Indeed it seems the drive to the ISS AOM and the secondloop output suddenly dropped right before the first loop opened but I don't notice a significant change in the diffracted power at this time (see attached screenshot). Unsure as of yet why this would've happened to cause this lockloss. Other than the ISS I don't notice any other obvious cause for this lockloss.

There wasn’t really much noise in DARM that was present at the X arm manifold. More noise can be seen on the Y arm but it seems like it is less than the end stations. First Valera and I tried shaking the Manifold with both shaker and human injections at 0.3 Hz. This produced nothing in DARM. We also tried to bang on and push/pull the tube around the manifold. This produced a resonant peak near 100 Hz but nothing like the microseism scatter noise we were hunting or the noise recently found at the X end . ( See 0.3 Hz tests plots ) I then performed a 1-3 Hz Sweep a 3-10 Hz Sweep a 5.43 Hz line 8.75 Hz line and a 21.43 Hz line. These tests replicate what we performed on the X manifold. For the Y-arm shaking I might have been too aggressive with the gain for the sweeps as some harmonics were present. These harmonics can come from the shaker connection to the tube if it is loose but the connection seemed good when Valera and I were out on the floor so maybe I just was shaking a little too hard. Despite the harmonics I believe that the noise found in our shakes still supports that the manifold scattering is largest at the End Stations followed by the CS Y manifold and then the CS X manifold. 1-3 Hz sweep showed up in the 60-100 Hz DARM BLRMS but was hard to pick out in a DARM Spectogram. ( SEE 1-3 Hz plots ) 3-10 Hz also elevated the 60-100 Hz DARM BLRMS and showed some noise in DARM but less than was seen for the End Station Sweeps . Of particular note are the two bumps in the DARM BLRMS around 7 and 8 Hz. ( SEE 3-10 Hz plots ). Each line injection in DARM produced somewhat similar noise in DARM as each other. The 8.75 Hz injection was to try and match where the excess noise was present in the sweep.

Here are two sets of instructions one that can be used while in observing to adjust this and one that can be done when we loose lock or are out of observing for some other reason. For these first few days please follow the out of observing instructions when relocking if this hasn't been done in the last few hours and please try to do it in the last few hours of the evening shift so that the temperature is close to well tuned at the start of the owl shift. Out of observing instructions (to be done while recovering from a lockloss can be done while ISC_LOCK is locking the IFO) ( screenshot ) : Make sure that ISC_LOCK will not set SQZ_MANAGER request to INJECT_SQZ by setting the request to ADS_TO_CAMERAs or any lower state. From sitemap SQZ_OVERVIEW set SQZ MANGER request to LOCKED_SEED_NLG. from the purple !SQZ scopes button open the NLG scope Once the SQZ manger is in LOCKED_SEED_NLG you should see that the red OPO_IR_TRANS trace on the scope is oscillating. Adjust the OPO temperature using the slider which is right under the purple SQZ scopes button to maximize the peak of the oscillations. SET_SQZ MANGER request back to FDS_READY_IFO and once that's ready you can set the ISC_LOCK request to nominal low noise. Before going to observing you can adjust the squeezing angle by requesting SQZ_MANAGER to SCAN_SQZANG. It is best practice to do this after the IFO has thermalized but it can be done early in the lock. If lock stretches are long and this has been done only early in the lock it may need adjusting for a thermalized IFO . Right now the squeezing angle has a strong frequency dependence early in the lock stretch so let's not adjust it until the IFO has been locked for at least an hour. In observing instructions: Both the OPO temperature and the SQZ phase are ignored in SDF and can be adjusted while we are in observing but it's important to log the times of any adjustments made. To adjust the temperature in full lock go to the purple SQZ_SCOPE button and choose the OPO temp scope adjust the OPO temperature to maximize CLF_REFL_RF6_ABS (the green trace). After doing this it might be necessary to adjust the SQZ PHASE which can be adjusted in steps of 5 degrees or so. Set this to maximize the squeezing level which you can do by watching the DARM FDS dtt template. It is available from the SQZ DTT purple button or on NUC33. It is easiest to adjust this for high frequency squeezing (around 1kHz) this should get you close to good squeezing at 100 Hz. Changes made to make this easier (Thanks Corey for beta testing the instructions): I've commented out the request to SQZ_MANGER that ISC_LOCK makes in low noise length control because that took control of the squeezer from Corey when he was giving these instructions a trial. The OPO temp is not monitored in SDF I removed the goto= True from the LOCK_FSS state. This will force SQZ_MANAGER to go through down after the NLG measurement (and turn off the seed PZT ramp).

Then there is a larger glitch that happened about 1 second before lockloss where POP18 drops below the trigger threshold and the DRMI guardian goes to DOWN at the same time the ALS Y arm looses green lock which then unlocks the ALS X arm. This glitch doesn't seem to be cause by the DRMI ASC although we were in the process of engaging that ASC when it happened. It also isn't due to the BS ISI isolation coming on which hadn't happened yet. Edit: I looked into a second lockloss from PRMI: 1412095134 this one is different in that it happens very quickly and PRMI and ALS signals drop out at close to the same time.

WP 12116 12117 . Last done in October 2023: 73524 . Followed instructions from 73524 65684 with additional notes below. Took SQZT7 area to local laser hazard and plugged straight into the OPO_IR_PD for our red signal and the OPO_TRANS PD for our green signal. Trying to take the signals from the outside of the table or the SQZ racks was confusing. Setup: Old style function generator offset 4.5V for a 1-9V scan at 10Hz. Oscilloscope and long BNCs/adapters: plug into function generator OPO_IR_PD and the OPO_TRANS photodetectors inside SQZT7. PZT driver MDT694 which has 0-150V output for 0-10V input connected this to the PZT1 connector in the back of the chassis using the adapter for PZT2 (note this means that the PZT2 offset we had been keeping at +10V was 0V for this measurements controlled by CLF SLOWOUTOFS 65535 ). Wincam dell laptop and gray E-870 PI shift driver box (stored in LVEA SQZ cabinet) and the OPO crystal cable remains attached +X HAM7 flange. What we did: After set up once we could see both mode scans on the oscilloscope we injected the seed beam and reduced green power from 30mW to 6mW to avoid pumping too much. Pico wasn't working: 80449 . Adjusted temperature to get red and green co-resonance. Plot attached of before spot move. In alog 73524 we used the OPO spot 2nd from the left. We moved (32 x 50 steps to right then 2 x 10 steps to right) to the next spot with a red-green co-resonance 3rd from the left. Plot attached. Increased the green power back to 25mW then 30mW and then things got confusing: we were seeing rapidly changing strange signals and negatives on OPO_TRANS channel. Beckhoff version of the channels looked better. We eventually found that the whitening filters must have been saturating and giving us strange signals. We increased SHG ISS drivepoint to 10V allowing us to use a lower green pump this showed that the high green pump was our issues. Then reduced the SHG power to 14mW while the SHG ISS drivepoint was in the middle of the range at 5V. When the ISS was engaged it could keep the opo_grTrans_setpiont_uW to 80uW with the controlmon around 6 and SHG_LAUNCH ~11.5mW. This is much less than the 30mW we needed this morning so this new crystal spot is much less lossy. OPO started to oscillate when we locked it so we reduced the OPO gain from -4 to -8 and accepted in sdf. Sheila set the opo_grTrans_setpiont_uW to 80uW in sqzparams.py and we measured the NLG to be 11 (Amplified / Un-amplified = 0.098/0.0089 see 76542 ). Ran SCAN_SQZ_ALGNMENT and SCAN_SQZ_ANG. This gave us >4dB of squeezing at high frequency. We left PZT2 (CLF SLOWOUTOFS) at 0V see 80450 . Today 75uW OPO trans power corresponded to 0.945 on the OPO refl diode last night that was 4.161mW on OPO refl diode. Meaning after this spot move we now need to inject a lot less power into the OPO to get the same output power. ,"{'term': 'H1 SQZ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80451,camilla.compton@ligo.org

We then went to no squeezing and set the offset back to it's nominal value and saw reduced squeezing when we reinjected squeezing. We could recover the better squeezing level by slowly stepping this offset back to 0V. We think that this could be because the PZT setting changes the alignment of the OPO and the squeezed beam coming out of it. (which also changes the squeezing angle). A similar effect was seen with PZT1 in 80396 and 78529 . It would be interesting another time to try changing this offset and seeing if we can recover squeezing by readjusting alignment and squeezing angle.,"{'term': 'H1 SQZ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80450,sheila.dwyer@ligo.org

There was some trial and error here mainly due to the difficulty in matching the phase as well as the rising gain of the transfer function above 100 Hz which you can see in this plot . This results in the best fit having some high Q pole just above 250 Hz and of course the usual struggle to keep the gain low below 10 Hz. I found better results when I limited the gain between 1 and 10 Hz to a maximum of 0.5 and also reduced my fit range to go between 10 and 60 Hz which is where the sensitivity improvement is required and then limited the gain from 100-1000 Hz to 0.02. PRCL is limiting the noise up to 30 Hz and far below th noise floor around 100 Hz so it's probably ok to keep the PRCL noise the same or just slightly worse above 60 Hz ( NB alog ). Finally with Gabriele's help I found a fit that worked! Here is the injection comparison with no feedforward and the new feedforward. I updated the DARM traces so you can see that the PRCL contribution to DARM is slightly worse around 100 Hz but much better up to 60 Hz by up to a factor of 10. The new filter is in FM7 (I have triple checked this!) and I have added it to the guardian and SDFed this in observe ( screenshot ). I did some chopping of the PRCL FF to check the improvement in DARM see plot . I think there is improvement between 20-30 Hz but it's hard to tell. I set out to rerun the noise budget injection of PRCL so we could remake the plots but there was a lockloss while I was measuring (I think because people were on the floor?). I don't think the lockloss was from the NB injection. ","{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80445,elenna.capote@ligo.org

Summary Of The Last 2-Years (Alphabetical list of people who have helped/been involved: C.Gray J.Kissel R.McCarthy J.Oberling T.Sadecki R.Savage TJ Shaffer R.Short B.Weaver) Upgrade To 200W Laser (Fall 2022) Until recently the last batch of Pulled Fibers were pulled in Fall 2022. At this time the Fiber Puller started having issues related to the laser ( f100 CO2 laser by Synrad 100W and 10600um)--this laser was well over a dozen years old and at the end of its operational life. Higher power lasers had already been purchased for the Fiber Puller about 5-years ago in preparation for an upgrade and a possible need to pull thicker diameter silica fibers for heavier suspensions. Because of this it was decided to upgrade the Fiber Puller with one of these 200W lasers ( f201 CO2 laser by Synrad 200W and 10600um). The 200W laser is bigger than the previous laser and because of this the back of this laser hangs off the edge of the optics table but Rick made a nice breadboard which offers a platform to support the back of this laser (see image1) . Cabinets and furniture were removed along the wall to allow extra space to for walking around this area of the lab. After RyanS and I installed the new laser & re-did the chiller plumbing we moved on to aligning the laser into the Fiber Puller. Since alignment work was next we took this opportunity to swap in new upper & lower conical mirrors in the Fiber Puller (Travis ordered these a while ago.). Alignment Work Begins (2023-2024) Then with the help of Karl Toland's thesis (Chapter 2) we started Fiber Puller alignment. This included Mechanical checks of the Fiber Puller which looked mostly OK it was noticed there is a slight tilt forward of the tower. We decided to not change this. The periscope which points the beam into the Fiber Puller was reconfigured to allow its translation stages (namely the horizontal one) to have better adjustability for pointing into the Fiber Puller--previously the horizontal translation stage only moved forward and back which did not allow for horizontal translations of the beam into the Fiber Puller (this only required us to rotate the translation stage 90deg). After this it was all optical alignment work and this proved to be non-trivial. Additionally one of the gold mirrors was burned. This mirror had a glass substrate so it was replaced with a gold mirror with a copper substrate (also took this opportunity to replace several dirty input gold mirrors). Then there was several months of no progress with alignment. Eventually Travis & Jason checked out the status of alignment. And in Aug 2024 Jason was able to give us a decent looking beam on our stock and after almost 2-years fibers were finally pulled again! Return To Fiber Pulling! ...For A Little While. Between Aug 2-20th six fibers were pulled (4 passes & 2 fails). At this point while preparing to pull another fiber one of the 1/8"" ID tubing to the shutter burst on Aug 20 2024. NOTE: Here I will paste in the email summary I sent to the group on Sept 26th. Recovery From The Plumbing Failure On Aug 20 2024 [start of email] Summary : After the 1/8"" chilling hose burst (8/20) weeks were spent with recovery and buying new plumbing hardware. There is now better hosing for the shutter + beam bender (mirror mount) and most of the fittings have been replaced with push-to-connects (excepted for barbed fitting of the beam bender (see image 6) ). We have been running the chiller w/ new plumbing since 9/17/2024. For the plumbing fix above this was done in-situ without removing the shutter or mirror mount with the hopes of preserving the alignment but first looks at alignment by myself and Jason at separate times did see an alignment change on our fiber stock target. On Sept 25th we were both able to work on the Fiber Puller and Jason was able to get us a decent alignment back we pulled our first fiber since the 8/20 chiller plumbing link---and this fiber also passed on 9/26! PLUMBING (see image 5) : The backstory is years ago a water-cooled shutter & mirror mount were installed (1/8"" ID plumbing using a mix of push-to-connect & barbed fittings) for the Fiber Puller. The water-cooled shutter & mirror mount were added in series to the laser (which has 1/2""OD tubing) via an aluminum manifold. During the 100W to 200W laser swap by RyanS and I we discovered everything downstream of the laser (1/8"" ID stuff) had been clogged (most likely for years) from the manifold downstream to the shutter + mirror mount. This led to us replacing all lines cleaning the manifold and starting to use OptiShield with the chiller water with hopes of preventing any corrosion clogs. This worked for a while during the upgrade and even through six NEW fibers pulled in August but after the 6 th fiber there was a huge burst in the tubing at the shutter. This led to repair work with a few issues/notes observed: Non-Water Tubing FAIL : The line which failed (I reordered what was originally installed) was very bendy and easy to work with. BUT over several purchase orders it was noticed that this line was rated for ""air"" use. This led to being more mindful of types of tubing. Firstly making sure we had (1) water-rated tubing and also (2) tubing with decent max-pressure ratings. Perhaps overkill but ultimately went with tubing with max pressure rating of 120psi. This new tubing was definitely much stiffer than the previous tubing. Metric & Inch : Previously--between the manifold shutter and beam-bender we had a mix of different fitting connections. Additionally because we were looking for: water-rated high max-pressure rating consistent fittings etc it limited options. Ultimately went with metric tubing + push-to-connect fittings (see image 4) . Able to make this change for everything except for the mirror mount ( it remained with its barbed fittings but it has 3 barbs and it feels like a good connection ). Additionally our pressures are pretty low (under 50psi)---not measured for the new 6mm lines but the chiller's pressure dial reads ~25psi for the system . 90deg Elbow Fittings Under Shutter (see images 2 & 3) : When the group checked out this plumbing work a few weeks ago TJ suggested elbow fittings under the shutter (mainly because this is where the previous tubing burst and the lines do take a bit of bend under the shutter here). New push-to-connect elbows were added. Pressure/Flow values & Adding Sensors : Had not really paid attention to what the pressure & flow of the system are through all this work but after the failure it was brought up by Travis and Jason. We have a Flow sensor on the supply line ( downriver from the laser) and a pressure gauge (also on supply side at the chiller). Just for a rough idea of numbers here are values observed: Flow sensor: this ran at 1.0gpm with just the laser but after the new 6mmOD system was added it's increased to 2.0gpm Pressure gauge: was running around 30psi at some points during the rework (more consistently at 26psi after the new 6mmOD system added) TO DO list: More Sensors! Would be nice to add more flow/pressure sensors at more points in the plumbing system--especially for the 6mmOD lines. With focus on getting operation back I did not get a chance to look into ordering this but we should do this at some point. ALIGNMENT Once Again : For all of the plumbing work above I opted to do it ""in situ"" by not ""touching"" the shutter or beam bender (I did not remove them from the beam path and only connected/disconnected their tubing)---this was all in the hopes of not changing the alignment---we had a nice alignment which produced decent fibers in August! Although I attempted to be careful with all of the plumbing work above first checks by both myself and Jason later showed we were off a little when we looked at the fiber stock target with the red beam. [On Sept 25 2024] Jason and I were both able to work together in the fiber lab. Here are some of the notes I took while Jason did his alignment magic! Coalignment of shutter's red beam with the main CO2 beam : It looked decent via a check of the co-alignment-beam-check path (via flipper mirror) that Jason and RyanS added earlier this summer. We made an ever-so-slightly small change via the shutter red-beam adjustment screws. Alignment Attempt #1 : Red beam alignment Jason went through alignment touch-up via the periscope mirrors. He was quickly able to get a decent beam on the fiber stock target. At this point he checked to see how this beam looked with the alignment irises which have been in place all the while (between the periscope and Fiber Puller). After aligning beam to the irises he once again had a decent beam on the fiber stock. In both cases there was a ""hot spot"" noted on the ""back"" side of the fiber stock. CO2 beam alignment With the main CO2 beam on a new fiber stock we needed to turn the power up to about 55-60% on the laser to be able to see the beam via the cameras in the Labview app. With the cameras I tweaked the (periscope mirrors) to get a better alignment (which allowed us to lower the power to about 50%). Jason had a try at tweaking alignment via the cameras (I believe this was his first chance getting to do this—especially since the side camera was better-focused on our stock back in August). We were able to optimize a little more but it still looked not great (see image 7) . I thought it might have looked like what we had when we were pulling fibers in August but we could clearly see it wasn't great. There was an angle on the fiber stock and the rear camera could clearly see the angle even more. I mentioned we could probably pull a fiber but we'd definitely have to increase the laser power. We did not pull a fiber however. We broke for lunch with hopes at more checks in the afternoon. Alignment Attempt #2 With Mechanical Offset Check Between Top & Bottom Clamp Translation Stages : Translation Stages : Thinking there was still something amiss mechanically Jason wanted to check the Top & Bottom Clamp Translation Stages. We do this using a special tool to set the Upper translation stage and the Lower translation stage (the latter we have not touched for a while). Jason went through several iterations of making small adjustments to both the upper and lower translation stages (see image 8) . On one of the final adjustments he intentionally overshot the upper translation stages. This was to hopefully help us later (it did!). Tower : NOTE: At this point Jason continued with mechanical checks and we looked at the Tower with a bubble level. There is an observable tilt forward of the tower albeit small. (this is mentioned above) Karl's thesis mentions this should be fixed but there are no tolerances given or go/no go values. And it's not clear how to do this without a major change to the system. There are alot of surface-to-surface mechanical contacts in the tower so one would need to loosen lots of bolts and then possibly install shims and retorque down everything. Anyway---a big job. Since it is a small tilt we are just noting it and decided to move on. In the future the Fiber Puller will need to be upgraded to a taller tower this will definitely give us the opportunity to remove the tilt from the tower (note: This could be a reason for [the known years-long issue of ] why we always have to make adjustments to the upper clamp translation stage almost every time we pull a fiber). Red beam alignment Once again Jason very quickly went through an alignment onto our fiber stock. One nice thing: no ""hot spot"" on back side of stock! CO2 beam alignment A new stock was installed and we heated it. We could clearly see the beam with the cameras at a lower power of 45%! (lower power than Attempt #1! Our 1st good sign!) And the 2nd good signs was the forward & back alignment of the stock was GOOD (in other words there was not an offset in this direction! Another sign the translation stage mechanical checks did us good!). The stock did show an offset in the other direction (""left/right"") so the translation stage was adjusted accordingly. Additionally the spot on the stock looked MUCH better on the cameras (3rd good sign! [see image 9] ). There were minimal angles seen with the ""ring spot"" on the stock! Touched up the alignment a little more but it was already better than how we looked in the morning. We were ready to pull! Vaporization Before pulling wanted to get an idea of what laser power we could go up to before silica vaporization begins. Ryan can correct me here but I believe Alan told us we should do pulls at laser powers just lower than the laser power when silica vaporization occurs. The laser power was slowly ramped up and I started seeing vaporization somewhere around 75-80% (it was very bright on the stock). Polish & Pull Not sure of what is the ideal values to use here but to just do it went with: Polish power = 55.5% Pull power = 65.0% Although late in the afternoon we went through the whole process. Fiber was profiled and then analyzed: PASSED! It had a bit of a low fundamental = 493.892 Hz This is where we ended for that day. Have continued to pull more fibers and get more data points with an eye on the fundamental (violin) mode frequencies. One knob we have here are those Polish & Pull powers. NOTE: A reminder that even with the 100W laser toward the end our fibers have been populating the lower range of violin mode frequencies (see fiber table ). Something to think about. Additional Note On Alignment & Power With our nice alignment it should also be noted we are still running at higher powers than what we are used to (which was at 85% or ~85W with the 100W). With the current 200W laser we were running at ~140W in Aug for pulls and yesterday we were at ~135W. This would point to a the overall alignment in need of some improvement.

This FSS issue seems to be having a serious impact on our duty cycle. I had a helpful conversation with Rick this afternoon about this issue he sugested that we trying looking for the glitches in other places in the PSL so that we could think about tests where we don't run some of the feedback servos and see if we still see the issue. I made an ndscope template with all the PSL fast channels I could find it is saved in sheila.dwyer/ndscope/PSL/PSL_fast_channels.yaml Looking at 1412111658 with this scope it looks like several of these channels that we are saving at a fast rate might not be connected for example the OSC and HPL channels are around 0. The only other channel that clearly shows these glitches is H1:PSL-PWR_NPRO_OUT_DQ. Request for operators: If you are having locking difficulties over the weekend it may be due to the PSL/FSS problems. To help narrow down the cause of the problem one could sit for an hour or two with the FSS unlocked and the ISS unlocked. If the glitches show up in the NPRO channel even without these servos locked then we will know that the problem is not from the FSS but from the NPRO.

Then we went to the diode room and followed instructions that Ryan Short gave me to turn off the two amplifiers in order then the shutter and then we turned the NPRO off. We went to the rack disconnected the cables and turned the NPRO on by turning on the button on the controller box. This conntroller doesn't have a switch on the front panel for the noise eater it was replaced by a cable which is no longer used.

I went through the noise budget code and found that these plots were made without median averaging. However changing the code to use median averaging is a simple matter of uncommenting one line of code in /ligo/gitcommon/NoiseBudget/aligoNB/aligoNB/common/utils.py that governs how the PSD is calculated for the noise budget. I reran the darm_integral_compare code using median averaging. The result shows much less difference in the noise at low frequency between these two times. The range is still improved from 10-50 Hz but there is a small drop in the range between 50-60 Hz. I still think the change from 10-30 Hz is likely due to PRCL. ,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80538,elenna.capote@ligo.org

Based on the previous noise budget measurements and the change in the coherence of PRCL from Sept 28 to Oct 5 I think the improvement in DARM from 10-30 Hz is likely due to the PRCL improvement.

New SQZ ASC using AS42 signals with feedback to ZM4 and ZM6 tested and implemented. We still need to watch that this can keep a good SQZ alignment during thermalization. In O4a we used a SQZ ASC with ZM5/6 we have not had a SQZ ASC for the majority of O4b. Prep to improve SQZ: No squeezing from 15:31:30 to 15:41:30UTC. Adjusted OPO temperature following no observing instructions in 80461 . Measured NLG to be 12.8. (0.1165/0.0091) following 76542 . This improved the squeezing from 2.5dB above 300Hz to 3dB at 300Hz and 4.2bD above 1kHz. Testing ASC from 80373 : Ran the ""reset as42 nosqz"" offsets script while in no sqz. SDF accepted. Put the input matrices form 80373 into SQZ ASC and checked they were diagonalized correctly by moving ZM4/6 in turn and watching ASC_POZ/ANG input signals. ZM4 pitch wasn't completely diagonalized but that others looked good. Reduced ASC_WFS gain from 0.1 to 0.05 cleared histories set all ASC_POS/ANG gains to 1 and one at a time turned on the inputs. We had some troubleshooting with POS_Y but there was a minus sign inside one of the filter banks we hadn't seen. In this troubleshooting we found the matrix was mostly diagonal so removed the cross-coupling terms for the YAW input matrix. Found WFS gain is better with lower WFS gain to 0.01 so we took a factor of 100 for the input matrix and left H1:SQZ-ASC_WFS_GAIN at 0.5. Accepted all in sdf. And edited sqzparams and reloaded SQZ_MANAGERT to turn on SQZ ASC. To test we tried the ""offload AS42 ASC"" script with the plan to compare the AS42 alignment with the alignment from the guardians scan SQZ alignment. The script didn't work as expected it's hard-coded to offload ZM45/6 rather than ZM4/6 that we are now using we should fix this or go back to using ther guardian states. After turning off the ASC and running again to clear histories this caused a lockloss probably as ZM6 P moved 60urad in 0.3s. See attached lockloss plot .

We suspected coupling at HAM1 and I tested this recently using local injections and the beating shaker technique. With local injections at HAM1 using shakers and HEPI we can produce much larger signals at the HAM1 table top then at the PSL or HAM2. The coupling site will likely have the same ratio of locally injected peaks to distant equipment peaks in its vibration sensors as the ratio of these peaks in DARM. The figure shows that the ratio of the injected peak at 25 Hz to the Air Handler peak at 26.35 Hz is consistent with coupling at HAM1 but not HAM2 (or any place else – most other potential coupling sites don’t even detect the peak injected locally at HAM1) The figure also shows that the beats from the beating shakers matched DARM at the HAM1 table top but could also be consistent with coupling at HAM2 so this technique as implemented gave a consistency check but did not discrimate well between HAM1 and 2.

The figure shows that scattering noise continues to be quite sensitive to the CP yaw on a 20 microradian scale. While re-checks did not previously suggest the need for a change after the initial setting ( 76969 ) the figure shows that this time the check suggests a new setting. The original setting -250 is now in a coupling peak. I suggest changing it to -325 (see figure). The second page of the figure shows that the coupling peaks are very repeatable.

BOSEM drift trends were reported in LLO aLOG entry 73180 . Initially we debugged a failure to actuate on the M1 SIDE channel for which swapping the BOSEM resolved the fault (replacement BOSEM S1900661). We measured BOSEM open-lights for the SIDE channel calculated gains and offsets and then centered the flag.We manually took DTT undamped TFs on the BBSS and then exported to Matlab.See 2024-10-07_1400_X2SUSBS_M1_ALL_TFs below for the first X2 (LLO) BBSS measurement.This has been compared with a measurement made at X1 (LHO) below. The plot key is as follows:-Blue Trace = Model (bbssopt).Orange Trace = X1 BS M1 (2024-08-30_2300). M1 LHO *net* blade heights average out to d1 = -1.5mmMagenta Trace = X2 BS M1 (2024-10-07_1400). M1 1st LLO measurement blade heights average out to d1 = -2.0mmTFs are looking fairly consistent between the sites and I believe we plan to change the d1 and remeasure. EDIT: Quick summary as also noted by Jeff K there are what appear to be roll-modes cross-coupling into the vertical DoF TF which is not observed at LHO so this should be looked into.

4801,L1 ISC - Analysis of Individual TR ERM PDs During Loud Glitches,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=73447,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Mon, 07 Oct 2024 18:10:29 -0500",[Tabata Gaby] Summary: the ERM PDs ( alog 72968 ) have correlations with DARM during loud glitches and these correlations are in most cases only with the X arm or only with the Y arm. The signals of individual PDs increase during loud glitches consistent with 'dust' scattering light back to the ERM PDs and forward to DARM. According to the OmegaScan analysis in most cases at least three PDs are affected during a loud glitch In the alog 73024 we analyzed the coincidences of Loud Glitches with TR ERM PDs through the SUM channels (ASC-X_TR_ERM_NSUM_OUT_DQ/ASC-Y_TR_ERM_NSUM_OUT_DQ). Here we present a quick overview of the data for the four individual PDs (L1:ISC-X_TR_ERM_SEG*_OUT_DQ/L1:ISC-Y_TR_ERM_SEG*_OUT_DQ) available from September 17th ( alog 73135 ). For the analysis we selected the 200 loudest glitches from September 18 to September 30. The lowest SNR in this dataset was 182. - Looking at the raw normalized time series the amplitude of the signal in the PDs goes up in most cases. This indicates that if dust is causing this it is probably scattering the light rather than blocking it. Image 1 presents an example where PD1 (blue) and PD3 (salmon) show an increase in signal during the presence of a loud glitch in DARM (black). - Image 2 shows the SNR behavior (y-axis) for each PD in the Y arm for 100 glitches (x-axis). We can see that they go up and down together most of the time suggesting that most of the PDs witness the signal. Interestingly PD3 in the Y arm seems to have the highest SNR in most cases as well. - Figure 3 presents the correlation from OmegaScan for the SUM channels for each arm. This illustrates the fact that when there is a high correlation with the X arm there is a low correlation with the Y arm and vice versa. In the previous dataset ( alog 73024) the number of coincidences with the Y arm was very similar to those with the X arm however according to OmegaScan the PDs in the Y arm show more correlations in this dataset. - From the plot in Figure 3 we set a threshold for the correlation equal to 10. Based on this threshold we calculated the percentage of PDs that have correlations above 10. As illustrated in Figure 4 more than 75% of the analyzed loud glitches correlate with at least three PDs which aligns with the plot presented in Figure 3 . We will further investigate this dataset including an analysis of the delays among the affected individual PDs. In addition we will calculate the coherence to cross-check with OmegaScan.

The rationale is as follows:1. The lines that appear during this short test appear to be mostly comb-like but that is not completely understood. Further investigations with more data collected would be required in order to assess what other line contamination appears while temporary AC is on. In addition we'd need to reallocate our overworked/shallow pool of personnel in order to separately characterize this temporary configuration.2. Noise mitigation efforts take a range of possibilities: 2a. vetoing the entire time the temporary AC unit is on (the sledgehammer) is fairly straightforward but it would mean the complete loss of the usefulness of the data collected during this time. We would rather not have to take this approach 2b. vetoing artifacts that appear during this interval which basically means repeating the lines-list creation but just for this short stretch of time. Considering it has taken a significant effort for the O4a epoch and that we're already working on other lines of investigation we'd rather not have to separately assess the temporary AC unit on time 2c. line subtraction has been proposed but we are not convinced that noise subtraction means that the data is now no longer contaminated. Even subtraction by a factor of 1000 means that there could still be contamination (we see evidence of this for the calibration lines for example). Thus we do not regard line subtraction as a promised solution. In addition someone would need to carry out this (non-trivial) subtraction work.3. We advocate for additional efforts to reduce noise coupling before the data is contaminated and we have to take on the heavy burden to additionally characterize the time the temporary AC unit is on. If these are successful then we do not have to treat this time interval in any special way. Hopefully reducing noise coupling by a factor of 100 is enough for the CW group. I also want to raise the issue that the Vela pulsar signal is putatively at approximately 22 Hz. We do not want to raise the noise floor in this region at all because it is high-profile potential CW source.

Overall terrible shift and locking due to many affected suspension sliders due to a dolphin crash at 22:30 UTC (around 4:30 PM). Not one minute spent in observing due to this crash that somehow changed everything. Here's a rough story: IR Not Found: IR was not found. Went into Input_Align in Initial_Alignment bright eyed and optimistic only to realize that this was also not working. Checked the ALS Overview to find that we were getting a beatnote and that guardian had indeed swept the full frequency range without finding any resonances. After some finagling and calling Daniel he pointed me to check IMs and PRs and indeed IM4 and PR2 were off in P and Y so I trended those values and then set them to their original. We were able to Find IR complete initial alignment and went all the way up to NLN. Unable to SQZ: Was happy to finally get to NLN (2:07 UTC) but then the SQZ was unable to lock FC.

I plotted the last eight seconds before lockloss for the various lockloss times. This time I split up the times into different graphs based on if the DC2 max displacement from zero in the last second before lockloss was above 0.06 (based on the histogram in previous comment): Greater = the max displacement is greater than 0.06 Less = the max displacement is less than 0.06. However I discovered that some of the locklosses that are above 0.06 for the DC2 channel are failing the logic test in the code: getting considered as having a max displacement less than 0.06 and getting plotted on the lower plots. I wonder if this is also happening in the histograms but this would only mean that we are underestimating the number of locklosses above the threshold. This could be suppressing possible bimodal distributions for other histograms as well. (Looking into debugging this) I split the locklosses into 5groups of 8 and 1 group of 5 to make it easier to distinghuish between the lines in the plots.

Settings before we started: Laser diode A set temperature 18.3C Laser diode B set temperature 15.99C laser diode injection current 2.134 Amps laser crystal set temperature 26.04 C laser crystal actual temperature 26.10 C. We went to the diode room and followed the notes from the procedure Ryan Short outlined to me to shut down the amplifiers turning off amp2 then amp1 then closing the shutter then we went one step beyond his instructions and shut off the NPRO. We swapped the controller with all the cables including the interlock. When we powered on S2200008 laser diode A temperature was set to 17.14 B set to 22.96C. We adjusted the pots on the front panel until they matched the values we had written down from the original controller. We turned the knob on the front panel for the injection current to 0. Rick and I went to the laser diode room and turned the NPRO back on Keita confirmed that this turned on the controller. We noticed that the laser diode 1 and 2 set temps were what we had set them to be by adjusting the pots for A and B but the act temp readbacks weren't matching we confirmed with photos that with the original controller the set and actual temps matched. (I will attach a photo of this state). At the rack Ketia turned the injection current up to about 100mA this didn't change the temperature readbacks. We had a discussion with Matt Heinze who agreed this is probably a readback issue and that it was safe to keep going. We think that this is because we haven't adjusted the pots on the LIGO daughter board following T1900456 . Keita slowly turned up the injection current knob while Rick and I watched from the diode room the NPRO power came back to 1.8W which was the same as before. The laser diode act power readbacks for diode 1 says 3.6W while it was 5W with the original controller and diode 2 says 2.48W where it also said 5W with the original controller. Since the power output is the same we think these are also just readback problems due to not following T1900456 . We opened the shutter turned on the amplifiers after a few minutes and set the power watchdogs back on as well as the pump diode watchdog. The PMC and FSS locked without issue Daniel found that the squeezer laser frequency had to increase by 850MHz to get the squeezer TTFSS locked so we moved the NPRO temperature up on the FSS by about 0.3 K. After this the squeezer and ALS lasers locked easily and Oli relocked the IFO. The first attached photo is the NPRO screen on the beckhoff machine before the controller swap the second photo is after. While Oli was relocking we saw that there are still glitches both of the attached screenshots were taken while the IFO was in the engage ASC state. Seeing this and based on Camilla's observation that the locklosses started 80561 on the same day that we redistributed gains to increase range in the IMC servo board in 79998 we decided to revert the change which was intended to help us ride out earth quakes. Daniel points out that this makes some sense that it might help to ride out the earthquake if we limit the range available to the carm servo. We hope that this will help us to ride out the glitches better without loosing lock. Rick went back to the diode room and reset the watchdogs after the laser had been running for about 2 hours. ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80566,sheila.dwyer@ligo.org

We measured the distance from the top of the ALS table to the optics TR-M2 and ALS-M18 as accurately as possible without altering the alignment so the measurements may not be very precise and could be off by a few millimeters. Additionally we measured from the inside top of the ALS table not the outside.

These blades were paired after deflection measurements at LLO. The results can be found in the HDS BLADE DEFLECTION MEASUREMENTS spreadsheet. We have received the necessary parts and hardware to proceed with the HDS dither mirror assembly (bottom mass). Over the next couple of weeks we will focus on these assemblies. Rest assured we will continue to make progress. A detailed description of the assembly process is available in the O5 HXDS Clean Assembly Notes T2300438 . The status of the fabrication QA and C&B status can be found at C2200203: HDS fabrication for O5 . More pictures can be found at O5 HXDS pictures .

11379,H1 ISC - Comment to NB injections taken,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=80603,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 10 Oct 2024 17:22:04 -0700","I ran an updated noise budget using these new measurements plus whatever previous measurements were taken by Camilla in this alog . Reminder: the whole noise budget is now being run using median averaging. I used a sqz time from last night where the range was around 165 Mpc starting at GPS 1412603869. Camilla and Sheila took a no-sqz data set today starting at 1412607778. Both data sets are 600 seconds long. I created a new entry in gps_reference_times.yml called ""LHO_O4b_Oct"" with these times. To run the budget: >conda activate aligoNB >python /ligo/gitcommon/NoiseBudget/aligoNB/production_code/H1/lho_darm_noisebudget.py all plots found in /ligo/gitcommon/NoiseBudget/aligoNB/out/H1/lho_darm_noisebudget/ I made one significant edit to the code which is that I decided to separate the laser and input jitter traces on the main DARM noise budget. That means that the laser trace is now only a sum of frequency noise and intensity noise. Input beam jitter is now a trace that combines the pitch and yaw measurements from the IMC WFS. Now due to my changes in the jitter injections detailed above these jitter injections extend above 900 Hz. To reiterate: the injections are still only band-limited around 2 kHz which means that there could be unmeasured jitter noise above 2 kHz that was not captured by this measurement. One reason I wanted to separate these traces is partly because it appears there has been a significant change in the frequency noise. Compared to the last frequency noise measurement the frequency noise above 1 kHz has dropped by a factor of 10. The last time a frequency noise injection was taken was on July 11 right before the OFI vent alog 79037 . After the OFI vent Camilla noticed that the noise floor around 10 kHz appeared to have reduced as well as the HOM peak heights alog 76794 . She posted a follow-up comment on that log today noting that the IFO to OMC mode matching could have an effect on those peaks. This could possibly be related to the decrease in frequency noise. Meanwhile the frequency noise below 100 Hz seems to be about the same as the July measurement. One significant feature in the high frequency portion of the spectrum is a large peak just above 5 kHz. I have a vague memory that this is approximately where a first order mode peak should be but I am not sure. There is no significant change in the intensity noise from July except that there is also a large peak in the intensity noise just above 5 kHz. Gabriele and I talked about this briefly we think this might be gain peaking in the ISS but its hard to tell from alog measurements if that's possible. We think that peak is unlikely to be from the CARM loop. We mentioned the ISS theory to Ryan S. on the off-chance it is related to the current PSL struggles. The other significant change in the noise budget is the change in the LSC noise. The LSC noise has reduced relative to the last noise budget measurement alog 80215 which was expected from the PRCL feedforward implementation. Looking directly at the LSC subbudget PRCL has been reduced by a factor of 10 just as predicted from the FF performance . Now the overall LSC noise contribution is dominated by noise from MICH. Between 10-20 Hz we might be able to win a little more with a better MICH feedforward however that is a very difficult region to fit because of various high Q features ( reminder alog ). Just as in the previous noise budget there is a large amount of unaccounted-for noise. The noise budget code uses a quantum model that Sheila and Vicky have been working on extensively but I am not sure of the status and how much of that noise could be affected by adjustments to the model. Many of the noisy low frequency peaks also appear very broad on the timescale of the noise budget plot. We could try running over a longer period of time to better resolve those peaks. Between 100-500 Hz there are regions where the sum of known noises is actually larger than the measured noise. I think this is because the input jitter projections are made using CAL DELTA L but the overall noise budget is run on CALIB CLEAN where we are running a jitter subtraction.

Short F. Clara S. Dwyer In the ongoing effort to diagnose the source of the glitches seen in the PSL we decided to try moving the NeoLase control box in the PSL racks back to rack power essentially undoing what was done in alog79593 and observe any changes in the glitch behavior. While H1 was unlocked during the commissioning window this morning I shut down the PSL in a controlled manner (in order of ISS FSS PMC AMP2 AMP1 NPRO) then Fil switched CB1 back to rack power and I brought the system back up. When back in the control room we very quickly noticed glitching in the NPRO output power channel as we've seen before and after locking the RefCav the FSS glitches also returned. Deciding this wasn't the solution we were looking for (and concluding it probably wouldn't have changed anything in the first place) I took the PSL down again for Fil to switch back to the bench-top power supply then brough it back up all without issue. Fil also took the opportunity to install a longer cable for this power supply to reduce the trip hazard potential next to the PSL racks. This closes WP 12133 . I'm tagging DetChar since this separate power supply was noted to have helped reduce a 9.5Hz comb seen in DARM but I'll reiterate that functionally nothing here has changed and CB1 remains on its own power supply.

All injections were run with CARM on one sensor (REFL B). The cable for the frequency injection is still plugged in as of this alog but I reset the gains and switches so we are back on two CARM sensors and the injection switch is set to OFF. All injections are saved in the usual /ligo/gitcommon/NoiseBudget/aligoNB/aligoNB/H1/couplings folder under Frequency_excitation.xml IMC_PZT_[P/Y]_inj.xml and PRCL_excitation.xml . I realized an intensity noise injection might be interesting but when I went to run the template for the ISS excitation I was unable to see an excitation. I think there's a cable that must be plugged in to do this? I am not sure. *********Edit************ Ryan S. sent me a message with this alog that has notes about how intensity noise injections should be taken. Through this conversation I realized that I had misread the instructions in the template. I toggled an excitation switch on the ISS second loop screen when I should have instead set the excitation gain to 1. I was allowed another chance to run the intensity injections and I was able to do so using the low middle and high frequency injection templates in the couplings folder. Also the Input jitter injections have in the past been limited to 900 Hz because the IMC WFS channels are DQed at 2048 Hz. However the live IMC channels are at 16 kHz so I edited the IMC injection templates to run up to 7 kHz and use the live channels instead of the DQ channels. That allowed the measurements to run above 900 Hz. However the current injections are band-limited to only 1 or 2 kHz. I think we can widen the injection band to measure jitter up to 7 kHz. I was unable to make those changes because we had to go back to observing so this is future to-do item. I also updated the noise budget code to read in the live traces instead of the DQ traces. Unfortunately in my rush to run these injections I forgot to transition over to one CARM sensor so both the intensity and jitter measurements that are saved are with CARM on REFL A and B.,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80596,elenna.capote@ligo.org

I spent time working on it all of this week and finally tried a setting I found in a Matrikon video about setting up the tunneller. I still don't know why this setting worked but it seems to have solved the initial connection problems. So as long as the OPC server is running which usually starts when the tunneller is started the client connects within a few moments. If the OPC server is not running it should start up after the client is started but it takes time for the server to load its configuration about half a minute. So the client will likely need to be killed and restarted after the OPC server has finished for the client to connect correctly. The way to tell if a restart is necessary is the FMCS data points will all be zero if the client tried to start before the OPC server was finished.The setting I changed in the Matrikon tunneller is in the Classic (COM) Details for the Siemens OPC Server. The setting is the sixth line down and is called Separator Chars and is blank by default. I added a period (.) as a separator character because the server uses a period for each level in the structure to represent a data point. For exampleManagementView.FieldNetworks.LIVINGSTONOBSERVATORY.WESTENDSTATION.Points.AA02AT.ValueIn the above example every period is a step in the tree that takes you to the proper data point location.The separator chars setting is supposed to speed up browsing so I guessed that this might help since timeouts were listed in the logs over and over again. I'm still not sure why this helped or even if it actually helped but since changing this setting the opcua client connects without any problems and with no delays.I also took the time to figure out how to add the missing OPC channel to the Siemens OPC server. In Desigo I added a virtual channel for the PSL room temperature and modified the script that forwards the virtual channels to the OPC server to include the channel I created. So all of the channels from the old OPC server are available in the new OPC server and I was able to receive data for the entire channel list with my test setup.I guess we still need to decide on a startup procedure not sure if Desigo starts automatically but at this time the Matrikon tunneller and the FMCS opcua client need to be started manually.One final concern I have the client running with no security enabled. I have been reading on how to generate security certificates with openssl and Mike T. gave me some pointers but I have not tried to do this yet. I'm not sure if we need to run with security since this is on an internal network but if so this will still need to be worked on before the client is ready.So the client without security is ready but the client with security will need more work.CDS FMCS,"{'term': 'LLO FMCS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73546,marc.lormand@ligo.org

In this case it incorrectly went to the SHUTTER_NO_TRIGGER state instead of the SHUTTER_FAIL state.Tonight around 3:14 UTC we had a lockloss where we had 3.8 volts peak which is above the threshold of 1.5 volts but did not see any action in the GS13 of HAM6. This suggests the fast shutter despite receiving a command to close and reporting that it was in fact closed via the Beckhoff readbacks did not actually kick the table which makes me wonder if it actually closed or closed at its typical speed. I do not see particularly large signals on the OMC DCPDs during the lockloss although our new AS port PD shows a typical amount of power due to a lockloss at the AS port (i.e. L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_11_OUT_DQ) so at the very least the PZT did its job even if the fast shutter didn't. For the moment I've corrected the LOCKLOSS_SHUTTER_CHECK guardian code to do the right comparison i.e. if we don't see a kick of 3e4 counts on the GS13 and the voltage of the trigger PD didn't go above 1.5 Volts then we should go to the SHUTTER_NO_TRIGGER state. In the case of no kick and voltage is higher than threshold (the case we had here) it will now correctly go to the SHUTTER_FAIL state.I've modified ISC_LOCK guardian to not return True in the down state if either we are in the SHUTTER_FAIL (which we will be going forward if this repeats) or the SHUTTER_NO_TRIGGER state keeping the ISC_LOCK guardian in the DOWN state. I'll want to revisit this in the morning or the next lockloss.So in summary DCPDs were protected. Unclear if fast shutter is working or if GS13 may have an issue. I've modified codes so the guardian should not proceed if we again do not see a kick associated with a lockloss irregardless of the threshold level at the moment and I've asked Karla to call me if we lose lock tonight.For reference the last time the LOCKLOSS_SHUTTER_CHECK guardian was in the SHUTTER_NO_TRIGGER state was May 9 2023 and looks like we were having Beckhoff slowcontrols issues and recovering from a power outage then so this looks to be the first real time this has been in this case and probably why I haven't noticed the logic error until now.,"{'term': 'L1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73506,joseph.betzwieser@ligo.org

The d1 values given in the legend for each model are the physical d1 values (based on the model) aka in the same set of d1 values as the ones originally given in the FDR document. Note that these d1 values differ from the d1 values given next to the measurements in Ibrahim's allbbss TFs from yesterday since those d1 values are based on the actual blade locations and theoretical center of mass. So since these d1 values don't line up between the model d1's and the d1's we get based on where we put the blades there is something more going on.

Sheila stopped me from just quickly changing that 3 to a 2 which would have broken the lock. Apparently Shelia relieved one of the Coil Drivers from driving and then changed the state of that Coild Driver while it was not driving. Then turned that coil driver back on and rotated it back into driving with the restof the Coil Drivers. The she would rotate another Coil Driver out of driving to update the state. Maintaining at least 3 coil Drivers at a time. Apparently there is a matrix change from driving with all 4 Coils to driving with 3 coils. Then change the ramp time and value from 3 to 2 then change the matrix to rotate through all 4 coild drivers to ""free"" a different coild driver from driving. is the procedure that kept our lock. Please see Sheila's alog . We believe that there was a change to Prep_for_locking that is supposed to update the state of the coild drivers before locking. P.S.

Attaching some trends of the PSAMS servo working overnight - Screenshot 1 - For ZM4 servo filter bank settings and ndscope trends of a step in the servo setpoint. The PSAMS servo output adjusts the applied voltage (see PZT DC voltage readback eg H1:AWC-ZM4_PSAMS_VOLTAGE_DC) to bring the strain gauge voltage readback (H1:AWC-ZM4_PSAMS_STRAIN_VOLTAGE) to the target setpoint voltage (H1:AWC-ZM4_M2_STRAIN_VOLTAGE_TARGET). Screenshot 2 - ZM245 PSAMS strain gauge voltage trends before/after servo. Before PSAMS servo (last few days) - the applied PSAMS PZT voltage is static and the PSAMS strain gauge voltage readbacks drifts (small amount). After turning on PSAMS servos the applied PSAMS PZT voltages are servo'd to stabilize the strain gauge readbacks to the ""TARGET"" values. Screenshot 3 - ZM5 suspension MEDM screen showing where the PSAMS servo filter bank and target setpoints are. This ZM5 suspension medm screen is in $(userapps)/sus/common/medm/hxds/SUS_CUST_HPDS_OVERVIEW.adl (Sheila helped us svn-commit this screen from LLO then Daniel pulled it for use at LHO). Daniel updated the PSAMS servo parts in the AWC block of h1tcscs.mdl found in userapps/trunk/tcs/h1/models. The SDF's appeared in the h1tcscs table (in the ""OAF"" box on the sdf screen). Daniel has sdf-monitored the PSAMS filter banks and left the ZM PSAMS PZT offsets sdf-monitored. Note these pzt offset values are basically meaningless when the servo is running. The ZM2/4/5 offsets are now all SDF'd around 100V so they would come back to ~nominal values after any resets.

Violins: We lost lock at 00:09 UTC (lockloss alog 80697 ) and have not been able to get to NLN since. A local earthquake rung violins up violently such that some are in the 8/9 zone. While the alignment is great (DRMI locked without PRMI 5 times) we have IX saturations starting at PARK_ALS_VCO. I initially thought this was an ALS or maintenance Tuesday issue but that doesn't seem to be the case. After chatting to Jenne we realized that it was indeed the violins. So I started damping. Setting all violins to their nominal damping states successfully prevented IX from saturating at ENGAGE_ASC_FOR_FULL_IFO where it was saturating consistently. Moving to CHECK_VIOLINS_BEFORE_POWERUP results in 1 saturation/second losing lock eventually (after 30 mins or so). Any form of powerup also loses lock immediately. I talked to Rahul and he recommended staying at a steady state to damp for a few hours since sometimes it just takes that long. Spoke to the incoming operator TJ and he's been informed of the unsteady state of the IFO. I'm already past this state but my recommendation (from speaking to Rahul) would be to stay at PREP_ASC_FOR_FULL_IFO at nominal damping for a few hours.,"{'term': 'LHO General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80699,ibrahim.abouelfettouh@ligo.org

Oberling After the NPRO control box was swapped last week and glitches persisted (see alog80566 ) we decided it would be best to switch back to the original so that signal readbacks for the NPRO would be accurate. I started by bringing down the PSL in a controlled manner (ISS FSS PMC AMPs NPRO) then went out to the LVEA PSL racks and swapped control box S/N S2200008 for S2200009. Since this is the control box that had previously been in service with this NPRO laser head no adjustments were needed to set the temperature and current to be correct. I returned to the control room and brought the whole system back up without issue. Once it was time to lock the FSS similar to what was needed with the last control box swap I manually moved the NPRO temperature down about 0.4K (from 0.19 to -0.23) and locked the RefCav so that the SQZ laser would be happy. I then updated the FSS search parameters and accepted them in SDF (see screenshot ). As I noted in the 10-day trends yesterday (see alog80665 ) PMC REFL has risen over the past week so I attempted a remote alignment tweak using the picomotors before the PMC. In the end I wasn't able to make much of any improvement to the PMC alignment. I also attempted a remote alignment tweak for the RefCav and here I was able to get a slight improvement from 0.80V to 0.81V on the TPD. Looking for more things to try to impact the laser glitching and hopefully bring down the amount of PMC reflected power Jason and I returned to the PSL racks to try adjusting the NPRO pump current. We ultimately raised the current from 2.12A to 2.19A increasing the NPRO output power from 1.82W to 1.91W according to the PD in front of the laser but not having much of an impact on the PMC. We also tried slightly altering pump diode currents in the amplifiers but we didn't see any improvement so these remain as they were. I concluded our PSL activities today with a rotation stage calibration following the steps in alog79596 . The measurement file new calibration fit and screenshot of accepting SDFs are attached.

DAQ restart was required the addition of 51 slow channels. WP12132 New Dolphin adapter card Firmware. Keith Jonathan Erik EJ Tony Dave: Downgraded firmware was loaded onto the Dolphin IX-611 adapter cards in h1sush7 h1cdsh8 and h1oaf0. This is to prevent sponteneous PCI level switching which is possibly the cause of some O4 cornerstation Dolphin glitches. Procedure was: safe the systems running on the frontend fence the frontend from the Dolphin fabric stop all the models run the script to load the new firmware power down the frontend then pull the two power cords out for about a minute plug the power cords in power up let it boot and start the models. WP12134 DAQ Restart Script Restart rts-nds.service Jonathan Erik Dave: To prevent /run/nds/jobs filling the scripts to restart the DAQ was modified to restart the rts-nds.service on the nds machines as well as restarting their rts-daqd.services. This allows systemd to empty the /run/nds/jobs directory which was over 50% full on h1daqnds1. We tested this as part of this morning's DAQ restart it worked well. WP12087 Add VACSTAT gauge PVs to DAQ Dave: My first attempt to add the VACSTAT PVs relating to vacuum gauge monitoring failed because the channel names exceeded the DAQ length limit of 54 characters. I modified the VACSTAT code to drop the _PRESS_TORR from the PT channels names which allowed these channels to be added to the DAQ. A new H1EPICS_VACSTAT.ini file was created which added 368 channels to the EDC. DAQ and EDC restart was needed. The new VACSTAT IOC was restarted and the new MEDMs installed into production. WP12143 Replace failed SDD in h1guardian1 Dave Jonathan Erik: cds_report reported a failed disk in h1guardian1's md3 raid at noon today. Jonathan and Erik found a failed 230GB SDD which is part of the root file system on h1guardian1. It was replaced with a 1TB SSD (the smallest we have) resyning the new disk only took about an hour. DAQ Restart Jonathan Erik Dave: We restarted the DAQ for the addition of h1tcscs slow channels and the new VACSTAT EDC channels. EDC was restarted its channel count increased from 57061 to 57429. This was the first test of the new restart script which after doing the round of rts-daqd restarts then restarts rts-nds on the nds machines.

I couldn't resist and it didn't take that long. I attach the unit-full transfer functions between the ISI Sus. Point Drive DOFs (L P Y and T) and the Top Mass SUS M1 OSEMs response in L P Y.It's.... a complicated collection of TFs and this isn't all of them that are relevant!Just to make the point that Dan DeBra taught Brian Lantz who taught me and we're passing down to Edgard Bonilla: *every* DOF matters the one you ignore is the one that will bite you.The transverse T DOF drive data set demonstrates this point. None of these transverse to LPY couplings nominally exist if we just consider first principles equations of rigid-body motion of an ideal suspension. But alas the on-resonance coupling from T to L P Y ranges from 0.1 ... to 50 [m/m] or [rad/m]. I may need to drive the ISI with an entirely different color of excitation to resolve these transfer functions above 5 Hz where it's perhaps most interesting for DARM but this is a good start.The ISI drive templates have been re-committed to the repo with the calibrations of each channel in place. (It was really easy: just multiplying each channel by the appropriate 1e-9 [m/nm] or 1e-6 [m/um] in translation and similar 1e-9 [rad/nrad] or 1e-6 [rad/urad].) ,"{'term': 'H1 SEI', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80688,jeffrey.kissel@ligo.org

KisselWP 12140 I've completed 6 SUS + 4 ISI = 10 of 12 total DOF excitations that I wanted to drive before I ran out of time this morning. Each drive was ""successful"" in that I was able to get plenty of coherence between the 4 DOFs of ISI drive and SUS response and some coherence between 6 SUS drive DOFs and ISI response. As expected the bulk of the time was spent tuning the ISI excitations. I might have time to ""finish"" the data set and get the last two missing DOFs but I was at least able to get both directions of LPY to LPY transfer functions which are definitely juicy enough to get the analysis team started.Measurement environmental/configuration differences of the HAM2 ISI from how they are nominally in observing: - PR3 M1 DAMP local damping loop gains are at -0.2 where they are nominally at -1.0. (The point of the test.) - CPS DIFF is OFF. (needed to do so for maintenance day) - Coil Driver z:p = 1:10 Hz analog low-pass (and digital compensation for it) is OFF. (need to do so to get good SNR on SUS M1 drive without saturating the SUS DACs)Interesting things to call out that are the same as observing: - The PR3 alignment sliders were ON. P = -122 [urad] Y = 100 [urad]. (Don't *expect* dynamics to change with ON vs. OFF but we have seen diagonal response change if close an EQ stop. Haven't ever looked but I wouldn't be surprised of off-diagonal responses change. Also DAC range gets consumed by DC alignment request which is important for driving transfer functions.) - Corner station sensor correction informed by the Bier Garten ""ITMY"" T240 on the ground. (the h1oaf0 computer got booted this morning so we had to re-request the SEI_CS configuration guardian to be in WINDY. The SEI_ENV guardian had been set to LIGHT_MAINTENANCE.) - PR3 is NOT under any type of ISC global control neither L P or Y. (global ISC feedback for the PRC's LPY DOFs goes to PRM and PR2.) There are too many interesting transfer functions to attach or even to export in the limited amount of time I have.

The downside of this is that the wiring of its data cable is not compatible with the current CDS setup and therefore on the MEDM screen the AIP still appears as faulty - see picture attached. The controller will be replaced shortly after the Varian controller is fixed. Until then the Agilent controller will be periodically checked.Nevertheless the Noble-diode pump proved to be an excellent choice again as it pumped the Annulus volume down pretty quickly (in about 7 minutes) below 1E-6 Torr. ,"{'term': 'LHO VE', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80686,janos.csizmazia@ligo.org

To prepare for the CO2Y laser swap next week: TJ and I moved the spare CO2 laser that just got re-gassed (S/N 20706 / alt link ) out to the LVEA. Turned on the FLIR camera and checked beam position with no mask central and annular masks. Checked the beam centering on irises (used PWM for iris before power control) and used new Thorlabs VCR6S detector cards which were great! The beam was to the upper left on first and second iris (didn't move irises). The beam was centered on the last two irises. We didn't scribe the current CO2 position at it was already pushed up against multiple beam dumps to record it's position. All water tubes were correctly labeled photo of laser pipe order the RF driver to laser cables were labeled on both sides as they connect to the laser see photo for how to plug into RF driver . ,"{'term': 'H1 TCS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80679,camilla.compton@ligo.org

Also since the NPRO controller was swapped 5 days ago but the potentiometers on the daughter board were not adjusted on the one swapped in ( alog80566 ) some of the readbacks for the NPRO channels are reporting inaccurate values namely the laser diode powers. The controller is planned to be swapped back to the original tomorrow so these readbacks will be fixed. Other item of note is that every time the PMC was unlocked last week it seems to have relocked with a slightly higher reflected power and corresponding lower transmitted power (see stabilization trends ). Looking at the PMC REFL camera image there could be something to gain from an alignment tweak into the PMC so I'll try that tomorrow during maintenance and see if there's any improvement. ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80665,ryan.short@ligo.org

These changes have been highly successful at increasing the range particularly the most recent couple of OPO changes. However this type of rapid improvement in the spectrum can create challenges when measuring the spectrum of the data in downstream data analysis pipelines (similar to how the sudden turn-on of the line subtraction was problematic). When the OPO adjustment has created significant changes to the spectrum the time periods during the transition should be CAT1 vetoed (tagging Detchar-request). As an example of these transitions I've included a range timeseries and a daily spectrogram with the transition time indicated. I also have included a before/after spectrum comparison showing the broadband improvement at high frequency. To mitigate the impact on data analysis pipelines future transitions should either be made while briefly out of observing or tracked by Detchar for CAT1 vetoes.

11958,H1 PEM - Identification of 30-40 Hz peaks in DARM,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=80655,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Sun, 13 Oct 2024 23:55:00 -0700",Over the summer Sam Robert and I investigated several peaks in DARM including one at ~35.4 Hz and a peak that oscillates between 30-40 Hz. The 35.4 Hz peak was found to couple strongly at HAM1 and HAM6 (see alog 79546 ). Shut-offs of the office area air handler and the main chillers showed that the peak decreases when these systems are shut off though it doesn't disappear completely. See Figure 1 and Figure 2 with office area air handler shut offs at 19:33:00-19:38:30 and 19:43:00-19:55:00 (alog 79888 ) and Figure 3 for main chiller shut offs (alog 73941 ). Note that there is also a fainter peak about 0.2 Hz above the 35.4 Hz peak as seen in Figure 4 but it is unclear if it also decreases when the HVAC is shut off. The oscillating 30-40 Hz peak tends to be near 40 Hz at the beginning and end of the UTC day and drops to near 30 Hz in the middle of the day as seen in Figure 5 .

I investigated the checks that RyanS went through last night in alog80639 to no avail I also tried setting FC1 & 2 back to their spots from the last time we locked the SQZer using OSEMs which didn't help either.

Huyen Brian O WP #11849 Starting Plan for the day for the fast shutter detailed in alog 73594 SUMMARY OF WORK: D1003325 fast shutter cap (which has the horns on it) removed from the fast shutter assembly 5 (the one that came from LHO) and the horn removed. The fast shutter alignment was checked and the fast shutter bobbin height was adjusted a little but and the overall position of the assembly has been moved from what it was prior to our entry into the chamber to allow for more clearance from the wire and to have the beam go into the beam dump. The modified fast shutter cap with the removed horn has been installed. Activity Log: ALL particle counts will be delivered in Cubic Feet in 0.3um/0.5um/1.0um size. All times are CDT. 08:30 LVEA is laser hazard 08:30 Removed shutter logic box to EE lab S1203627 08:30am HAM7 cleanroom Particle Counts 20/10/10 08:31am Removing the ""horn"" piece ( D1003325 ) from Spare Fast Shutter S/N 002 to modify it to remove one of the horns 0849am In HAM5/6 cleanroom PC 0/0/0 08:52am In HAM6 chamber PC 20/10/10 08:54am Checking fast shutter alignment in HAM6 with the beam flashes and adjusting fast shutter position and alignment so that beam hits the tombstone and it reflects the beam into the beam dump. It had to be rotate some and they have to increase the height of the tombstone. They are using the slotted adjusters on the fast shutter assembly to try to bring it up ~2mm. 09:24am Removing the position markers we put down to mark the fast shutter position as we have moved the fast shutter and they are no longer relevant and we may need the holes to dog clamp it 09:27am Checking alignments of various beams on the fast shutter and taking some videos of where the beams are etc 09:45am Happy with alignment of everything. Beam is about 1cm from the wire. But fast shutter has moved in position slightly so we will have to rebalance the ISI we believe. This pic shows the new position of the fast shutter on HAM6 ISI 09:58am Going laser safe in LVEA 09:50am Removing the fast shutter cap (the part that has the stops on it) from the installed assembly. Removing D1003325-V2 S/N 005 09:58am In chamber Particle Counts 30/10/10 10:02am Modified part has arrived and we will install. The Part number is D1003325-V2 S/N 004. Taking some pics of the part. The wrong leg that we wanted to be machined off was cut off. 10:04am Installing part on the fast shutter. Unfortunately we cant make it work. Luckily we have a spare to modify.

Adam is going to move the wire a little bit more. 11:15am Tested a bit more slow up and down with the bobbin. Adam is more happy with how the wire is now. He is taking some pics of it. 11:17am Setting up for testing the fast shutter at operational speed ~100x 11:29am High voltage on and getting ready to start our tests 11:30am Test fire #1 while filming. Looking at movie taken to see if we are happy with everything 11:37am Test fire #2 while filming. Investigating the mirror/peek bobbin etc and everything looks good. 11:39am Going to start doing a number of test fires. Test #3->#5. 11:42am Starting to do test #6->#20 11:58am Starting to do test #21 while filming again to try to get a better video with better lighting 11:59am Starting test #22->#30 12:03pm Adjusting camera angle to get a better picture when filming 12:10pm Starting test # 31->#40. Taking a break to see if we see anything in terms of stress points on the mirror bobbin glue joints etc. We used a FLIR camera to look at the heating of the wire shutter etc to see if we observe overheating from firing it repeatedly. (This is also why we are only doing this in a small grouping before breaking) 12:20pm Starting test #41->#50. We thin k we might see evidence of the wire touching the remaining stop. They are going to try to alter the wire a bit more. 12:30pm Turning OFF high voltage so that we can adjust the wires/clamping of the wire thats hitting the remaining stop 01:10pm Turning ON high voltage so that we can try to do more tests. Starting Test #51->60 01:18pm Wanting to hook up trigger box. During that we heard (and it was seen) that the fast shutter went up and down 'violently' (we could hear it outside the cleanroom) up and down at a reasonably fast speed . 01:25pm Wanting to do more tests but with the paddle again. Starting Test #61->70 1:29pm Doing one last inspection of the Bobbin and we see no cracks etc. Looks the same as it did at the start. 01:30pm Turning OFF high voltage 01:32pm Finishing up some cable dressing on the ISI. 01:41pm Exit particle counts in chamber 30/20/20 01:46pm Exit in cleanroom particle counts 10/0/0 Handing over to ISI balancing team while we take lunch ","{'term': 'L1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73595,matthew.heintze@ligo.org

Overall this leads to a counter clockwise rotation of HAM6 and a shift in the positive Y. To measure the position of the ISI and Stage 0 we selected a few holes on each surface that we could easily get with the FARO. As expected we found that the ISI has a similar shift and rotation as its support tubes (0.246 degrees). The tabletop is also ~1.8 mm higher than the CAD drawing.

Calum joined by zoom. We then met again at 0800 CDT this morning and decided on this plan of action for today. - We will remove one of the hard stops the one that was closest to being impacted by a flexing wire. We feel that the history of use and the design makes this a safe option. Joe Hanson will perform the surgery using clean tools. - We will transition to laser hazard and Anamaria Adam and others will work to reposition the fast shutter so that the flexing wires are not close to the interferometer beam. - The modified hard stop will be installed and we will then test the fast shutter for 50-100 cycles with periodic inspections for signs of damage. Our estmate is that this is 5-10% of the expected number of cycles the shutter will undergo for the remainder of O4. - If we have a failure then our fallback is to try to repair the kinked wire in the original fast shutter assembly. This is not ideal but should allow us to return to operation while a better replacement is made ready. More details to follow.

The limit stops for the fast shutter are only there to prevent the bobbin jumping out upon catastrophic failure. The stops should be set well above the range of motion described by the bobbin during normal cycling. The bobbin slows to a stop on its upward travel by use of magnetic breaking afforded by the magnetic field set up by the current from the driver. Bad things happen if the driver terminates its pulse while the bobbin is moving upwards as there is no breaking. That's when the mechanical limit stops come into play. If the bobbin hits the limit stops it will likely break so that should be avoided and is not a factor if the system is not malfunctioning in some way. Another little thing buried in history is that of the dressing of the thin Teflon wires used in the bobbin flexible connection. By studying the high speed camera footage we opted for a dressing style that minimized the observed whip-like wire motion present in the earlier attempts. One should endeavor to duplicate the lengths and shapes seen in the installed unit as it reflects the best known practice to avoid whip failure of the wires as they flex. Best of luck to you all.

At one point we checked the voltage output from the driver and coudln't get it to change from 14V so in the interest of speed we just grabbed the spare hooked up power outside the rack (but not the high voltage or beckhoff slow controls connection) confirmed that output expected voltages and used that for testing.Turns out we had forgotten a safety feature of the Beckhoff slow controls for the high voltage driver was to maintain the fast shutter in a closed (up) state if the high voltage is not ready as a safety precaution to protect the down stream photodiodes. Since we had turned off the high voltage on Friday to do testing the Beckhoff system was forcing the chassis to constantly put out 14 volts and because the bobbin in the spare fast shutter was installed backwards was constantly forcing it down when we did the initial connection with the original high voltage driver.Testing today in the EE shop has confirmed normal functioning of the original high voltage driver chassis and it was just a mistake on our part along with the reversed polarity of the fast shutter which confused us initially. So despite suspicion early in the week there was no failure of the original driver just the fast shutter wiring.We are discussing how to setup a safe measurement of the high voltage drive to confirm the output signal matches expectation and nothing funny happened with the spare driver chassis when we had the spare fast shutter catastrophic failure.,"{'term': 'L1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73577,joseph.betzwieser@ligo.org

We are currently waiting on a spare Bobbin to come from LHO (from 3rd IFO) to try to repair one of the units we have. We do not believe we can repair either of the units we have right now. Below is a quick summary of where we are at: Original Fast Shutter S/N 005 * Issues with measuring open loop where we should of measured 20 ohm resistance for the coils * During debugging to try to find the issue two pins on the in-vacuum cable (at the flange) became dislodged. We didn't really touch them that vigorously so suspect that they were getting closer to being at a failure point and us touching it just was the final ""straw that broke the camels back"" of failure * Swapping to a new in-vacuum cable did not allow the original fast shutter to be operational. Our current suspicion(but still to be proven) is that it might be due to a kinked wire (the black tube Anamaria is holding in the picture is what the wire normally goes inside of and the kink is at the top of this tube) Spare Fast Shutter S/N 002 *New shutter Installed. Had to be installed 180 degrees in rotation to the original rotation as Bobbin installed backwards and so HR side of fast shutter mirror was facing the ing the wrong way. Also when we cabled it up as per the original fast shutter the polarity was backwards. * Connected up fast shutter so that the polarity was correct and fast shutter HR mirror was facing the correct way. Using the paddle controller to control the fast shutter we were successfully able to command the fast shutter to go slow up and slow down as per our commands (and the correct direction). * We installed the fast shutter in position (we had marked the position of the old shutter). We had to shim underneath the length of the fast shutter to alter the pitch of the beam from the fast shutter into the beam dump as the beam was ~1inch too low. * Clamping of the wires to not touch be caught get in the way of beams was where we spent the most time yesterday * Once we were happy we tested the fast shutter first with 'slow up' and 'slow down' commands and it worked fine. we then tested it ~ 5 times at its operational speed ('fast up'). End of Day 1 *This morning we finished cable dressing the cable from the ISI to stage zero and then unlocked the ISI to test the fast shutter one final time (in its ""fast up"" state) to see if we saw the usual ""kick"" in the sensors on the ISI we typically see when the fast shutter fires and also to take a slow motion video (with a phone) to see the operation. It was on this final test of the fast shutter that the tombstone part of the fast shutter broke away from the rest of the peek part it is glued to and landed on the table. *Note: Adam and I were the ones chamber side when this final shutter actuation took place. We have high confidence the broken part did not hit anything else in HAM6. It hit the flashlight I was holding above the fast shutter and landed on an open piece of real estate in front of the fast shutter (on the -Y side of the shutter). * Additional note: Ive added a picture of the part that failed and also a picture of how it should be attached (picture courtesy of Betsy at LHO who has a dirty unit and has been supporting us also from afar). * One more additional note: When we had the two side by side (""spare"" one that failed on the left and ""Original"" one on the right) we see that the hard stops on the spare is much lower than what the original hard stops was set to General Non-image files attached to this report fastshutterfailure.mov ","{'term': 'L1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73576,matthew.heintze@ligo.org

I have the ISP-1000 and its respective logic fully operational. The ISP-1000 is using the same push buttons on the Turbo panel as the old screw pumps and has the same inlet valve logic as the HEPTAs. The automatic set point via a labjack T4 has been installed but the relay driver tick on pins FIO5 FIO4 GND and VS is not operating as expected. The Labjack is reading the voltages from both gauges and converting to pressure. It then updates the setpoint only if pressure is dropping. However if the pressure rises above the setpoint the Labjack reports that the setpoint is tripped but it fails to write FIO5 low to trip the safety valve. I am using the same Labjack and program that I had previously tested successfully in the VPW last week. We also think that the tick might be directionally dependent for how voltage is applied to the tick relay contacts RA RB and GND. Further testing is required. If this cant be resolved the dual range gauge is still wired in series with the labjack and it can be used to set a static setpoint just like we had before.

She is opening the top of the soft cover. 1322 In-chamber PC: 30/20/10 1323 Anamaria is going to index the fast shutter location with Adam M. 1328 Index complete. Joe B and Michael have moved the (newly replaced on Friday Oct 11) fast shutter driver chassis from beside the chamber to inside of the rack. 1330 De-cabling and removing the fast shutter. Leaving the spacer. Anamaria is bringing the new fast shutter into the chamber. CLASS A Spare Fast Shutter D1003318-2 https://ics.ligo-la.caltech.edu/JIRA/browse/ASSY-D1003318-2 1337 They’ve cabled up the new shutter Michael L is garbing to check the cabling. Putting the dog clamps back on for now. Will have to tighten up after re-alignment. Lockers are still on the shutter. 1340 Joe B is checking at the in-air cable at the chassis connector. Looks healthy. He plugged it into the chassis. 1342 Joe B turned on the chassis and Anamaria heard the clunk as expected. Slow up is working. Checked twice. It went down when he removed his finger from the paddle for slow up. Michael L is checking Anamaria’s connections. 1346 UP is closed. Joe B hooked up Beckhoff but the high voltage is not on so he can’t use Beckhoff to open it but the readout looked OK. So he unhooked Beckhoff. Michael L has verified that Anamaria’s connections are OK. 1353 Taking photos of WFS A. We need to go laser hazard for the rest of the tests. 1410 We are laser Hazard. Joe B is isolating LVEA ISIs except for HAM6 because its locked. 1413 Trying to lock IMC. Trying single bounce. SRM Is 2000 counts off due to Anamaria’s intentional misalignment. PRM is off 2000 counts again due to Anamaria’s intentional misalignment. 1423 Aligning all suspensions they were in a safe state. 1427 All SUS are untripped all ISIs are untripped and Anamaria sees flashes. 1430 Anamaria feels that it is aligned enough to close the shutter. Joe B hooked up Beckhoff and the shutter closed. The alignment is a bit low. Opening the shutter. Opened. Adam M and Anamaria are checking the alignment. About 3mm. 1436 Adam asked Joe B to close the shutter. Huyen is checking the locked ISI position to see if that’s a factor. Huyen reports that the ISI is only about 7 microns down in that corner. So Anamaria and Adam M agree to remove the spacer underneath. There is a chance that the old shutter was at a different vertical spacing than this one. 1443 Removed the spacer under the fast shutter. Checking now. It looks perfectly centered. The new shutter points down a bit so it hits the beam dump lower. They are adjusting the beam dump. 1448 Aligning the fast shutter. It’s pitched. 23” x 12” working out the angle that it is off in pitch. D1201293-v2 wedged blocks may work. They are made to different angles. 1457 Considering a 3 deg wedge and that’s too much. Matt is getting some Class A alum strips which could run the length of the fast shutter bottom plate. 1510 Trying Alum strip. 1515 Strip seems to work give good angle. Checking with the beam – making sure that the wire is not clipping the beam. Looks good. 1522 Moving folks away from the chamber as Joe B turns on the high voltage. He’s engaged the high voltage. Checking functionality. Down and up. Checking a few times. Turning the high voltage power supply off. 1541 Taking a video of the beam of the fast shutter with the shutter down/open. They’ll take the video again with the shutter up/closed. Putting Beckhoff back on so Josh does not need to hold the button on the paddle. Huyen has a complicated video camera and is providing instructions. 1554 Final configuration needed for wires. Clamping them down. Adam M and Michael L working on this cable dressing. 1600 List of activities remaining - check for fast shutter repeatability pointing & hysteresis check beams on WFSs unlock ISI. Decided to input an after-hours work permit to complete this today. We have an operator in the chair until 7pm. 1622 Joe B is slowly opening the fast shutter. Now putting it back up. Checking beam pointing. Putting it down. Checking it going up and down. Looks good – Anamaria wants to loosen one of the cable clamps. It may sit a bit more flush/further back which is good. 1629 Modifying the cable clamp now. Making a new one. 1653 Still getting the cable dressing just right. It’s better. Checking the up and down slowly. Joe B is using the paddle to cycle through ups and downs. Cable dressing discussion. More discussion. 1712 More cycling of the shutter. One wire is slightly touching but touching something soft. They’re taking photos. 1717 Taking a video of fast shutter opening and closing slowly with paddle. Setting up Beckhoff for fast shutter opening and closing fast. Joe B is going to turn on high voltage. They have their reference. Joe B has turned on high voltage and reading back 150 V. Triggering fast shutter with Beckhoff. A wire moved (bad). Turning off high voltage. Disconnecting the high voltage cable from the chassis. May have bent the wire. They need to remove the slight twist in that one wire. 1728 They removed the clamps and are now trying to untwist the wire so it’s straight. 1748 Anamaria showed what the wiring issue is with the viton tubing photo. She found a kink in the wire of the old fast shutter. Could be the problem. 1805 Re-dressing the cables. Testing the fast shutter with the paddle. The wire is not touching. Joe B is hooking up the high voltage to perform the fast test. It is now turned on. Capacitors are charging. Fully charged to 230 V. Testing fast opening and closing. 1814 Taking a video of the shutter closing and opening. Going to laser safe. Turning off high voltage. It’s off. We are laser safe.

It was bent to clear that. 0959 Michael L taking continuity measurements. Direct resistance of the fast shutter coil. 1000 Across the peek screw terminal – across the coil open. Trying again – still recording open. Now he’s measuring directly to the pins – still open. Screw terminal connecting two wires vertically – should see 20 ohms but it is open. He put the probes on the screws and the end of the barrel for the measurement. We will need to replace the fast shutter itself. They measured vertically across and horizontally across. Reference https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/uploads/73522_20241010123110_IMG_2038.jpg 1003 Taking a photo down at the bobbin. 1005 Michael L says that the screws seem tight. Josh suggested measuring across the in-series terminal block. He sees open. 1007 Anamaria is climbing up to take a look. She can manually move the shutter. 1012 They are going to try removing the screws that are holding the pins in on the bobbin side. 1012 Turning the illuminator off as it’s shining in their eyes. 1013 Anamaris is holding one probe Michael L is holding the other probe. End to end on the bobbin. It’s open. Still open when Anamaria is moving along the pin with the probe – still open. With one particular position of the probes it reads 20 – 22 ohms. 1016 Randomly the north crane is working. 1017 Between pin a and c should be a short. 1019 Seems like its coming back and forth – they’re measuring the coil again. Fluctuating between 20 ohm and 100 and open. We see 20 ohms through the coil itself but not at the terminal block. But they didn’t see that in the beginning. Manipulating the pins a bit now shows 20 ohms. 1024 Josh is going to get the probe clips with the toothed jaws. Going to install the pins again into the terminal block. It now measures 20 ohms. They screwed the cable at the outside of the chamber flange back in and are going to check it at the chassis. A and B should be 20 ohms. https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/uploads/73522_20241010123110_IMG_2038.jpg 1028 A and B at the chassis is 20 ohms A to C is 20 ohms B to D is 1.4 ohms A and C is 1.2 ohms. 1029 They are switching out the probes to ones with toothed jaw to remeasure in-chamber. All they did was reseat the pins. But that doesn’t explain the B to D short. 1031 They screwed in everything. Anamaria is agitating the inner connector at the flange it went open. Then it went back to 22 ohms. Fluctuating short to 22 ohms when she’s manipulating the connector. Pointing towards feedthrough or cable. We have not had it steady open which is what she’s trying to induce. She can’t get it to stay open. So she’s checking B and D now. It’s reading 1-2 ohms. She’s moving the cable. Steady open then back to 1. Flickering now…still. She’s pressing it back and it’s at 2ohms but it’s flickering between 1 to 5 ohms. Flickering between 1 and open. 1038 Taking the whole connector out of the feedthrough flange to do a continuity check at the connector. Two wires came loose from two cable connector pins. Speculation that the connector at the flange got loose. They’ve measured the in-air cable many times but they’ll try it again. They’ll have to swap the in-chamber cable. They’ll test the fast shutter by itself. 1059 They are removing the in-chamber cable from the cable clamps traveling up the HAM ISI. 1100 Anamaria is removing the cable at the PEEK. She needs to add black glass back into the holder. 1103 They are putting the new cable in chamber. There is no serial number on the cable. They are considering moving the terminal block so the wire won’t have to turn so sharply. They are not going to change the position of the terminal block but are going to reconfigure the pins to try to avoid bending the pin/wire connection on the cable. 1111 For reference https://dcc.ligo.org/DocDB/0114/D1400225/001/FastShutterAirVacWiringChain_v1.pdf 1115 They’ll wait to dress the new cable after testing. 1121 They’re testing pin 2 to 4 which is supposed to be short and it’s showing 0.7. One connection is still fluctuating but now shows 20ohms. Michael L is double checking the B and D as open Rechecking the coil by moving the probe up and down the crimp pins. Looks good. 1126 Anamaria is connecting the new cable to the feedthrough. 1127 They are using the new driver with the paddle (test board). Connecting up the cable to the driver. Turning on the driver. She heard something not sure what. Michael L says that he didn’t see the shutter move but perhaps the shutter moved when the driver was powered up. He remembers that from Friday. Testing slow up. Testing slow down. Nothing happened to the shutter for each. Power cycling the driver. Pressing slow up – light goes on. Nothing happened. Turning the driver off again. They’re going to do a whole continuity measurement. 1131 Josh and Huyen are checking at the cable. A and B is open which should be 20. B to C is 1-2 ohms but then it was jumping around. Anamaria will screw in the connector at the feedthrough better. She’s waiting for a longer L-key. 1144 Josh is checking the driver itself. A and B is measuring 14 volts. It looks good. 1135 Anamaria has completed reseating the connector. 1136 Back to rechecking the cable. Open connections. Some cursing. Re-jostling. Seeing fluctuations. Open. More cursing. 1139 Wires are not marked so it doesn’t look like there is laser damage. 1143 Taking lots of photos including of the WFSs and REFL PD. By eye we did not see any damage. 1152 Taking In-chamber PC before putting on soft cover: 200/25/00 1154 Cable has not been fully dressed. Soft cover halfway down for FARO work.

I've used a 3 hour stretch of observing time for the old NPRO and a three hour stretch before the time when Jenne made a plot in 80837 . The ISS is not on for the new NPRO time which is probably why the intensity is flcutuating and making it harder to see the small steps in power that are the glitches we are looking for. In the second panel I've plotted the data high passed with a 0.05 Hz butterworth this helps to show the glitches although not perfectly (in either case).

Overall the squeezer pump ISS is working and ready. With GAOM1 an inch closer to SHG maybe GAOM1 alignment got smoother than before. We have an alignment that can optimize both 0-th order throughput and diffraction efficiency which seemed problematic in recent realignments (eg 80266 79993 78519 ). With 43mW into GAOM1 we transmitted 40mW at 0V (so 40/43 = 93% throughput) while being able to diffract ~15mW at 5V (28.5 dBm) so ~35% diffraction efficiency. Seems ok-good compared to recent re-alignments. Pump fiber coupling might be improvable (see lho72081 for reference) but is OK for now. With 20 mW launched into the fiber we had about 2 (BS50:50) * (2.2mW (opo_refl unlocked) + 1mW (opo_refl_rejected)) = 6.4mW through the fiber so 6.4/20 ~ 32% throughput even with ~0.1mW mis-polarized light. Given the questionable yaw beam quality when no parts are installed on the SHG output path and the dependence of yaw beam profile on SHG temperature it might require work on SHG to totally solve the beam quality issues. Unclear that further mode-matching adjustments will fix it. First attchment here plots all the beam profile measurements from this round (friday and tuesday). Same as Tuesday. Pitch looks good. Yaw does not look consistent with pitch and not quite gaussian either. See photos of the beam profiles in the second attachment here : the yaw profile degrades as we go further from SHG while the pitch profiles look consistently good. Yaw profile looked bad even with no EOM or AOM installed so it is a bigger issue. Could be related to SHG problems since the yaw profile depends so much on SHG temperature. After adjusting the EOM alignment the yaw beam looked more single-peaked after the EOM but was still not a great gaussian (see photos ) and it got worse as the beam propagated farther from SHG.

Short J. Oberling Weekend work on the PSL NPRO swap continuing on from Friday . Saturday 10/26 We started today by taking a beam propagation measurement with only L01 installed to get a better idea of if it was properly positioned as our Gaussian fit for the Amp1 beam was well off what we expected from JamMT. However the resulting Gaussian fit didn't make sense so we took another propagation measurement. This fit differed from the first so we suspected either something was up with the profiler or something in the beam path was distorting the beam (or maybe both). To check if something was up with the profiler we switched profilers from the WinCam to the ThorLabs scanning slit this required a different rail setup since the ThorLabs is larger than the WinCam and would be well above the beam with the rail we were using (we tried mounting it a couple different ways to the original rail we were using to no avail). We took a profile and got a completely different result for the fit. I'm writing this from home so I don't have the numbers on me at the moment. Going back to the WinCam and looking at the beam shape on the profiler the beam wasn't exactly good looking (see first attachment). Since we had seen the EOM change beam alignment I tried moving it around a bit while watching the WinCam and sure enough as the EOM alignment changed the beam shape changed. At this point we broke for lunch. After lunch we removed the EOM from the beam path and looked at the profiler again 2nd attachment. The beam was more round and less ""stretched."" So we took another beam propagation measurement with the EOM removed. This one was different from the rest and did not match what we expected based on JamMT's results with a f = +222mm lens 100.0mm from the NPRO. Now the suspicion is our initial beam propagation measurement in the lab was somehow wrong. At this point I remembered that while in the lab we needed 1.67A to get ~1.8W out of the NPRO as measured by one of the small stick power meters this same NPRO installed in the PSL needs 2.144A for ~1.86W. My guess is the power meter in the lab is suspect and if so means we were under-pumping the NPRO during the initial beam propagation measurement. Under-pumping the NPRO changes the divergence of the output beam and therefore our Gaussian fit and mode matching. To check this we set a turning mirror to direct the leakage beam from M01 into a beam profiler and took a propagation measurement. Sure enough the results differed from what we got in the lab: Horizontal Waist: 153.0 µm @ -102.0 mm Vertical Waist: 143 µm @ -90.3 mm Pretty different from what we had in the lab which meant we had to redo the mode matching again. We were able to find what looked like a good solution see final attachment. We broke for the day at this point it had been a long one. Sunday 10/27 With new mode matching solution in hand we began by installing it. We checked and corrected the position of L01 then took a look at the EOM. We put a spare EOM in the beam path (with no RF) and it did not distort the beam like the in-service one did. We then put the in-service EOM back in the beam path and sure enough it stretched the beam as we saw yesterday. Unsure if this is normal (I don't recall seeing this during installation back in 2021) but not knowing RF well enough to feel comfortable messing with it on a Sunday with almost no one onsite we decided to remove the EOM from the beam path continue with the mode matching install and talk to Fil on Monday. We got the mode matching solution installed and aligned and took a beam profile measurement. It took a few iterations but we were able to get a beam with an average waist size and position where it needs to be for the 4S-HP amplifier. Ultimately we had to move both L21 and L02 25mm away from the amplifier increase the distance between L21 and L02 by ~3 mm (we had shorted it during install the distance was supposed to by 86mm and we were at ~83mm) then move L01 away from the NPRO by 2.0mm. The results of our final Gaussian Fit: Horizontal Waist: 159.0 µm @ 1791.0 mm Vertical Waist: 172 µm @ 1797.0 mm Average: 165.6 µm @ 1794.2 mm Target: 165.0 µm @ 1794.0 mm We broke here for the day. Tomorrow we will talk to Fil about the RF so we can take a look at the spare EOM and will then continue with Amp1 recovery.

12192,H1 PSL - PSL NPRO Swap Day 4 (WP12155),https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=80885,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Fri, 25 Oct 2024 17:29:55 -0700","J. Oberling R. Short We continued on from yesterday . We started by rough aligning our beam through Amp1 in preparation for beam propagation measurements to assess how well we installed our mode matching solution. We had done a rough alignment previously so expected this to go quick but it was more off than I expected. We also checked our beam polarization going into FI01 (after WP01) and going into Amp1 (after WP02) using a temporary PBSC as an analyzer. The beam should be vertically polarized w.r.t. the table top in both locations. Going into FI01 the beam was definitely as vertically polarized as WP01. But after WP02 roughly 50% of the beam was in horizontal polarization (~50mW beam almost 24mW in horizontal polarization). This is not good and not how we left this after our PSL recover work in March of 2023 wrong polarization through the amplifiers has a large effect on output beam quality (as learned with the O3 70W amplifier). This immediately sent up red flags for us referencing our slowly increasing PMC Refl (increasing since March '24 we swapping the PMC in July because of this). Immediately we suspected something in FI01 was bad/broke/wrong and could have been for a while (if something in FI01 had been slowly failing and changing the output beam polarization while failing that would explain the slowly increasing PMC Refl as changing the beam polarization from vertical through the amps negatively affects their output beam quality). We have been using the old Faraday isolator from the 35W Front End laser but we have 2 spare Newport FIs identical to the one being used between the amplifiers. Unfortunately we only have one other FI pedestal base and it puts the FI at a 100mm beam height not 4"". We looked through all of the spare pedestal bases from the O4 laser upgrade hoping to find one like is used for FI02 (puts the beam height at 4"") but no other spare FI bases were found. We also measured the throughput of this Faraday at ~85% which is lower than the ~93% we had at install. Something here isn't right. While checking the FI mount situation out the alignment situation was bugging me so we took another look. Checking back through our alignment again we noticed it was off on our alignment iris in front of L02. So L21 and the EOM were removed and alignment checked again. The alignment was fine on our first iris but a little off on our second. M02 was tweaked to fix this then the EOM installed and its alignment tweaked. At a point where the EOM alignment looked good on our iris near L02 we decided to check power in and power out and found we were losing ~6mW through the EOM (this is at a lower alignment power of ~74mW). We put the power meter at the output of the EOM and adjusted the EOM alignment until the power out of it was maxed best we could do was ~70mW out with 74mW in. At this point we looked at the iris near L02 and the beam was a tiny bit high but for the most part looked OK so we moved on. L21 was reinstalled and its alignment tweaked. Now to deal with the Faraday but first lunch. After lunch we swapped the Faraday with one of the Newport spares. Since the pedestal base was a little too short we used a couple of shims under the Faraday to get it at the correct height. Without making any adjustments to the Faraday we checked the beam on our temporary PBSC still installed after WP02 and found almost no beam in transmission. With no changes to the waveplates or tweaking of the Faraday the beam was now much better vertically polarized lending credence to the theory that something had finally failed in the older Faraday we'd been using (we'll see if this was the source of our PMC Refl issue once we have the PMC up and running again). We tweaked the angle of the input PBSC on the Faraday to minmize the rejected beam lowest we could get was 0.40mW. We then flipped it around and tweaked the output PBSC to minimize the transmitted beam lowest we could get here was ~17µW we saw ~11µW once but we were unable to maintain this while clamping the output PBSC. Since we found this at ~55 µW we called it a win and moved on. The Faraday was flipped once again and we began setting up for beam propagation measurements. These measurements are done with a leakage beam through M03 so we installed a rail (we have blocks in place to make this easy) and set up the WinCam beam profiler. We then increased the power back to ~1.8W by rotating WP14. After a little bit figuring out the basics of Varun's script which we haven't ran since 2023 we were able to take one measurement before we called it for the day: Horizontal waist: 86µm @ 1774.0mm Vertical waist: 102µm @ 1766.0mm Average: 94µm @ 1770.1mm Our target is 165µm @ 1794.0mm so we have a little work to do here. We called it here for the day and will continue with mode matching tweaks and Amp1 recovery tomorrow.","{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80885,jason.oberling@ligo.org

The last time a full flush was done and not just refills from line leaks or chiller swaps was back in 2016 ( alog30017 ). This is notably much longer than the 6mo service interval the manufacturer recommends. Just like back then after turning off the lasers power supplies and AA chassis we disconnected all electrical and tried to drain the chillers to start. We struggled to get much out of the chiller via the drain pipe but a trickle would come out of the process input if the ball valve on the back of the chiller is set to a 45deg angle. After the chillers were mostly drained we tried to wipe the reservoirs to get out any junk that was in there. We then set up a hose with a quick connect and connected it to the process input line and ran it to a bucket below the mezzanine to avoid carrying large quantities of water down those stairs (see attachment 1 ). The process output was hooked up to the chiller then with two people on the mezzanine and one below to watch the bucket and hose we turned on a chiller and filled the reservoir as the level dropped. We put about 13 gal through the system for each before turning off the chiller which should be more than each system contains ( alog30638 ). Seperately I noticed while we were swapping the TCSY laser that some of the 1/4"" tubing connected to the RF driver felt softer than others also connected to it. Turns out 2 of the 8 connected to it are a different type - Tygon 2001 (softer) vs Tygon2475. According to a data sheet I found the 2001 has a max working pressure of 30psi compared to the 2475 max at 50psi. We should really think about replaing all of these lines post O4 but I'll need to look into how much pressue these lines actually have.

I think they should be. This is a drive from the blended input of the control loop (well several because it's in the EUL basis) to the signal seen on the GS-13 in the same EUL basis converted to displacement (so it will roll off below 30 mHz because the the realtime calibration of the GS-13s in displacement rolls off and it has a bump at 30 Hz because this is really the complementary sensitivity and that has a bump because of the servo bump) But it should be really close to 1 from 0.1 to 3 Hz. The rotational DOFs (right side red line) look pretty good but the translations (L V T) all show a similar non-unity response. Jim and Brian should discuss. They look similar to each other so maybe it's a blend which isn't quite complementary?

Oberling R. Short C. Compton T. Guidry J. Driggers Continuing from yesterday this morning Camilla and Ryan began First Contact cleaning the lenses for our chosen mode matching solution. I met with Tyler and he modded the spacer plates for us. Once that was done I went into the enclosure to begin building the new lens mount stack and place the rail for it. While in there also looked at exactly where on the table our new lens would be going. In checking this I found a discrepancy in the As Built layout the NPRO was placed in the wrong position 1/2"" back from where it's actually sitting. Seeing this I left the enclosure and re-ran the mode matching to account for this change in distance to Amp1's input beam waist location. The solution stayed the same but the lens locations changed slightly. I finished this as Ryan and Camilla were finishing up the lens cleaning and it was almost lunch time so we broke for lunch. After lunch Ryan and I went into the enclosure to start installing the mode matching lenses. While in the enclosure Jenne (from the CR) and Ryan worked to find the script that Varun wrote back during the '21 laser upgrade to quickly do a Gaussian fit to beam propagation measurements which will really speed up checking the results of our mode matching they found the script and it lives in /ligo/gitcommon/labutils/beam_scans. We then installed L01 an f = +222mm lens and recovered the beam alignment. With the new L01 in place we then re-installed the EOM and aligned it. Next was installing the new lens an f = -334mm lens now known as L21. We roughly placed it then used a scale to measure back from M03 to place it more accurately. It was at this point we discovered yet another discrepancy in the As Built layout I had not put the beam path from mirrors M03 and M04 on the correct row of holes which added 2"" to our NPRO to Amp1 distance. So once again we left the enclosure to take yet another look at mode matching (we have now discussed talking with CDS about getting JamMT on one or both of the computers in the Laser Room this requires an installation of the Java Runtime Environment) the lenses did not change but their positions did (as expected) see attached. This done we went back into the enclosure to install the last 2 lenses in the proper locations for our mode matching solution. We had to remove WP02 as L21 now sits where WP02 once did (not a big deal the position of WP02 is not critical). This done we installed L21 and aligned it during alignment we had to drive the lens to the furthest extent of the lens mount to align the beam which should not be the case if our M02 to M03 alignment was good. Turns out we were checking the alignment at a bad point beyond M03. M03 and M04 are used to align the beam into Amp1 so the beam won't be exactly on a row of holes there but the alignment jig we use (one of the tall posts with pinholes in it at beam height that we stick a power meter behind then adjust the optic being aligned until power is maxed) sit on a row of holes. By aligning L01 the EOM and L21 to a point beyond M03 we were steering the beam off of our previous M02 to M03 alignment. So we moved the alignment post to in front of M03 and re-aligned L01 the EOM and L21 things looked much better after that. Finally we installed and aligned the new L02 an f = +222mm lens.

12207,H1 ISC - PR2 and PR3 BOSEM coupling,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=80862,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 24 Oct 2024 17:59:45 -0700",This alog builds off of the work done by Joshua to measure PR2 and PR3 BOSEM coupling in alogs 80732 and 80814 . His injections showed that PR2 coupling to DARM occurs up to about 12 Hz and PR3 coupling up to 25 Hz. To note: these injections were performed above 10 Hz and the measurements were able to pick up some coupling between 7-10 Hz as well. However I think the most significant coupling and limitation of the BOSEMs likely occurs in the auxiliary controls below 5 Hz. There is some indication of that from these measurements. I used his injections to investigate the pathways of this coupling. I modeled my scripts after the scripts that Sheila has written previously to measure couplings to DARM through multiple pathways as in 80730 . I made two plots one showing each PR2 bosem contribution to DARM and one showing each PR3 bosem contribution to DARM . There is also a set of plots attached to this alog that show each PR2 and PR3 bosem coupling to DARM projected through MICH PRCL SRCL CHARD P and Y and PRC2 P and Y ( PR3 ASC PR3 LSC PR2 ASC PR2 LSC). Overall these results indicate that PR2 and PR3 coupling to DARM through ASC and LSC loops are fairly minimal. The PR2 and PR3 noise seems to show up most strongly in RF9 so there is strong coupling to PRCL and PRC2. I predict there is probably coupling to CARM especially for PR3. As a quick test I compared the LSC REFL RF9 Q error signals during the injection and saw coupling of the PR3 BOSEM noise up 30 Hz ( dtt screenshot where reference trace shows quiet time live trace is during the PR3 T2 BOSEM injection). As an example I projected the BOSEM noise to PRCL PR2 projection and PR3 projection (the result is uncalibrated). I think if we injected at even lower frequencies we would see that PRCL is greatly limited by this noise. If we would like to do further tests to investigate this coupling we should: inject at lower frequencies open the POP beam diverter to see the appearance of this noise on the POP WFS and move to 1 CARM sensor to see the appearance of this noise on an out-of-loop CARM sensor. The POP WFS test would help us understand if for example this excess noise on PR3 is causing some sort of jitter that couples to DARM. This would help further understand why PR3 BOSEM seems to couple strongly to DARM up to almost 30 Hz but only appears weakly in the auxiliary DOFs. However it is also important to finish investigating the contributions of all triple suspensions so PRM BS and all the SRC mirrors. I made all of these plots using the utils code from the aligoNB repository.

But given the current sign is actually better for DARM the model error doesn't really matter and it's not really worth changing signs. The wrong HD angle sign seems to be why none of our quantum noise models despite fitting all other SQZ angles well have ever fit FIAS properly. We will update our quantum noise models for the noise budget. Attached are some quantum noise models and DARM plots for Camilla's recent SQZ dataset lho80664 . Plots with optimal FDS (optimal fc detuning) for both signs of the homodyne angle: showing 1st just the quantum noise models without adding back non-quantum noise (NQN) and 2nd showing QN models + NQN. Current sign of DARM (+) has solid lines. ""Other"" sign (-) has dashed lines. Homodyne angle is only really obvious for FIAS (freq-indep anti-squeezing turqoise traces). It's almost indistinguishable for FIS otherwise (green yellow light blue). Marginally noticeable for FDS (but more sensitive to FC optimization). Sheila made a super important observation that FIAS has never fit quantum noise models properly. Quantum noise models with the ""other"" (-) sign expect FIAS < No SQZ between 15-100 Hz and FIAS < FIS between 15-50 Hz. This is not what we have observed with FIAS despite QN models fitting all other SQZ angles fine. Only flipping the HD angle sign was able to match the QN models to data suggesting that previous quantum noise models used the wrong sign of the homodyne angle. It turns out this doesn't really matter in real life but we will update the noise budget models. Confusingly the current (+) side is better with FDS but the ""other"" (-) side is better for unsqueezed DARM . See the grey (+) vs. black (-) traces for unsqueezed DARM at +/- 10 deg homodyne angles. Not sure where the notion of a ""good side of DARM"" comes from Pre-O4a there was a quick test to lock on the other side of DARM lho68080 ... But maybe this test just shows some technical noises change with the HD angle? In the test see the plot of how unsqueezed DARM (purple vs. red) is very different below 100 Hz for the two signs but not in the pway predicted by quantum noise models (grey + black traces) . So seems like this test suggests the +/- sign measured DARM noise differences are more likely technical (non-quantum) noises that change with homodyne angle. Third attachment ( 3rd ) shows a wider range of homodyne angles from +15 deg to -10 deg. So far the code for these plots is living here . --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Altogether this is making progress on the quantum noise models for the noise budget! Summarizing updates and what we're learning: As Sheila said low freq frequency-independent anti-squeezing (FIAS) ---> homodyne angle (which sign it is + approx how many degrees ): see light blue FIAS traces in 2nd plot . Elenna recently measured the contrast defect in lho80806 corresponding to a upper homodyne angle of +7.4 deg (down from the +10.7 deg measured in O4a ( lho71913 )). After subtraction FIS matches reasonably well with this lower HD angle +7 deg . Still +10.7 deg is only marginally different so FIAS is not really precise enough to tell at the ~degree level. As in lho80318 79951 can use the frequency-independent squeezing (+mid-sqz) bronchosaurus (FIS) ---> SRCL detuning. After subtraction FIS matches reasonably well with SEC detuning between 0 and -0.2 deg . Subtracted FDS data still WIP as the low frequency quantum noise estimate seems not totally right. Maybe could fit the FC detuning at each SQZ angle (as SQZ angle can affect the RLF-CLF offset for such low (sub-linewidth) FC detunings) but haven't thought about this FDS data much yet. Important model degeneracies remain from having 4 model unknowns: [[ IFO arm power + readout loss and SQZ NLG + injection loss ]] with which to fit 3 DARM measurements [[ unsqueezed shot noise + anti-squeezing (kHz level) + squeezing (kHz level) ]]. Still need to factor in mode-matchings. SQZ ","{'term': 'H1 SQZ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80820,victoriaa.xu@ligo.org

We've seen this happen in the past and I've written some wrapper functions to help with this - (userapps)/sys/h1/guardian/timeout_utils.py. While looking through the code with Sheila and Dave separately it definitely seems like this node has been edited a bit and has been left in an odd state in need of cleanup. So I: Removed the unnecessary counters and other unnecessary code in the CHECK_SHUTTER state Added the timeout function calls to the nds data request and some logic around it Changed the edges a bit for slightly better state flow Added a few more comments doc strings and notifications for clarity We also noticed that ISC_LOCK doesn't actually look directly at this node before powering up anymore. I looks like it was commented out in Dec 2018 for some SRY testing then never put back in. The node was still watched by the top level IFO node so it would still have stopped us from Observing as it was the case last week. I moved that bit of code to the AS_SHUTTERS state where we already check the FAST_SHUTTER node (this node runs a test on the shutter before power up vs LOCKLOSS_SHUTTER_CHECK will check if it fired during the last high power lock loss). This way we won't power up if there was no GS13 kick on the last high power lock loss. I tested the LOCKLOSS_SHUTTER_CHECK node by running it through the checks normally and with the value of the GS13 kick incredibly low so it would flag a failure. This node is loaded and ready and I reloaded ISC_LOCK with the new conditional in the AS_SHUTTERS state though I have no yet ran this state since we have no IFO right now.

12217,H1 SQZ - Initial beam profiling after GAOM1 (used for squeezer pump ISS),https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=80830,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 24 Oct 2024 09:58:40 -0700","Sheila Daniel Vicky On Tuesday Sheila and I took some beam profiles of the squeezer pump beam after the pump AOM used for ISS (GAOM1). This is trying to understand and fix the squeezer pump ISS issues that result from GAOM1 becoming misaligned on SQZT0. Summary and proposed plan: the vertical beam profile we measured looks reasonable the horizontal profile looks off (potentially related to measuring after the AOM). We could move GAOM1 closer to SHG by 1-2 holes to get closer to the beam waist of ~100um that is about 1.3m after SHG. While GAOM1 is out we could re-measure the horizontal beam profile to make sure it is OK. Here are plots of the pitch beam profiles we took before and the very quick a la mode plot code that adapts Sheila's and Georgia's previous codes. I think the vertical beam profiles we took line up with Georgia's previous measurements and D1201210 which both say there should be a waist like 1.25m - 1.3m after SHG. In real life we measured from z=0 at the EOM mount edge closest to GAOM1 to the face of the beam profiler (may need to take into account beam profile distance..). So it seems possible that GAOM1 is like 0.02-0.05 meters (~2 inches?) downstream of the waist. From photos and SQZT0 layout D1201210 there is room to try moving GAOM1 closer to L15 (closer to SHG) by 1-2 holes. At LLO ( example photo) GAOM1 misalignments are not a pump ISS problem - and their GAOM1 is also several holes closer to L15 than LHO's (which is what these profiles suggest to try). Kinda ignoring the horizontal beam profiles here since we measured after GAOM1 and the beam's yaw profile was not fitting well while measuring. The pump beam after GAOM1 looked kinda double-lobed with some smaller outer fringes even with the AOM drive at 0V where it should be ""passing everything"" and not diffracting but maybe there was some RF leakage.. The profiler's fitting function was fitting both lobes at once and being thrown off by the fringers so likely over-estimating the waist in yaw (blue). Worth checking the beam profile without the AOM in place. Useful DCC references: SQZT0 layout D1201210 and mode-matching document here : see pg.4 should be a waist of w0~100um at z~1.3m from SHG. SQZT0 Green AOMs for PUMP + FCGS paths: E2000561 . GAOM1 for pump ISS is M1250-P200L-0.75 a 200 MHz AOM with aperture of 0.75 mm. Updated +200MHz label on SQZT0 medm screen.

Short J. Oberling F. Clara Continuing from yesterday this morning Ryan and I looked at mode matching solutions and found one we liked see attached. It seems pretty robust in that we can have the lenses several mm off and still get >99.9% mode overlap (not easily seen in the picture as the other lens positions are off screen). Once the LVEA was transitioned to Laser Safe we went out to do the readback adjustments on the new NPRO. All of the adjustments were going well until we got to the Laser On/Off Monitor adjustment. For information on this particular adjustment see the file 'Some further information needed... .docx' in T1900456 . No matter how we adjusted the potentiometer we could not get the PSL Beckhoff software to recognize that the laser was on. We installed a 25-pin breakout board and looked at the voltage all we saw was 0.032 V. No matter how the pot was adjusted this value never moved but very occasionally jump up to a higher voltage (1.5 V to 2.5 V range). This looked like a connection problem so we took the power supply to the EE shop and enlisted Fil's help in figuring this out. We referenced what little wiring diagram info we had to carefully trace the signal path check the proper resistor was installed in R33 (4.7k it was correct) and made sure all the wiring had been done properly (it was). Fill cleaned some excess flux from around where the remote board picks off the signal it needs to detect if the laser is on or off (for future reference this is the top side of power supply resistor R1 for the ON signal and the left side (when looking at the vertically mounted circuit board from the inside) of component T11 for the OFF signal). He also didn't like the way the solder around remote board resistor R33 looked so he reflowed it. At this point he wanted to power it up so we plugged it in. Unfortunately the power supply interlocks itself if no laser is attached (as expected) so we took the power supply back out to the PSL racks and hooked it up to the laser (but not the Beckhoff system). A breakout board was hooked to Diagnostics port 2 and we turned on the power supply. With the laser off the pin read 0V (as it should) and with the laser on the pin read ~7V (yay!). So apparently either cleaning the flux or reflowing the solder fixed the connection problem. We then wired the power supply to the PSL Beckhoff system and tuned the correct potentiometer so the voltage was at the ~10V it should be. The software correctly detects when the laser is on when it is off and is capable of turning the laser on and off and all of the diagnostic readbacks are reading the correct values. At this point it was after 1pm so we broke for some lunch. After lunch we went in to the enclosure to begin recovering Amp1. With all of the lenses between the NPRO and Amp1 removed and the NPRO power turned down to ~85mW (using WP14) we roughly aligned the beam through Amp1. We had ~53mW incident on Amp1 and were able to get 2.38 mW in transmission. While this doesn't seem like much there are no lenses installed so the beam is overfilling the amp's entrance aperture and every optical element inside the amp so this is expected. When I had removed lens L02 it was a little stuck in its mount and when it came out I inadvertently put my thumb right on the surface. So time was spent getting the lens cleaned before storage. This done we then grabbed the lenses needed for our mode matching solution. Back in 2021 we had stored them with First Contact on them so we removed it. It left behind a large amount of residue on every surface so the lenses require cleaning again. As we do not have First Contact in the PSL enclosure we contacted Camilla about the location of more. Since neither Ryan nor I have worked with First Contact much Camilla offered to clean the lenses in the morning since it was already 4pm we took her up on that offer (Thank You!!!). We then began building the component stack needed to mount the third lens of the mode matching solution. Turns out when we installed this PSL confiuration back in 2021 we used all of the spacer blocks designed to put the lens at our 4"" beam height so all we had left were the old spacer blocks designed for a 100mm beam height. What we do have however is small 1.6mm spacers that could be used to get the height correct but they needed modified so they work with our larger spacer block. I contacted Tyler about doing this quick mod in the morning and he agreed (Thank You!!!). So on deck for tomorrow: Lens cleaning (Camilla) 1.6mm spacer mods (Tyler) Install mode matching solution align lenses take beam propagation measurements and do Gaussian fit to ensure mode matching is doing what we expect modify if it isn't Begin aligning through Amp1 and powering it up ","{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80854,jason.oberling@ligo.org

It does see a few occasional glitch-like features (see attachment) but they are (a) much less frequent than the old laser and (b) no more than 1/2 size. Another factor to consider is that overnight the PSL environmental controls were left on so this is a noisier environment than we normally have. Also no external servos (eg FSS) are engaged. I've tried to make the y-axis about the same as the orig laser (blue) plots from yesterday so that it's easier to see that these rare glitches are indeed much smaller than the ones on the old laser. EDIT: Sheila and I looked at this plot along with some others that Oli had created a few weeks ago and it looks like these small 'steps' in the power that are shown here may be of the same type that we had with the previous NPRO. I'm still hopeful that they are smaller and less frequent though.

The first plot is similar to Oli's from 80520 blue shows the monitor at all times and orage shows only for times when the IFO was in a low noise state (600 or more) for the whole minute. Since the blue trace includes transients from the locklosses there isn't much of an apparent trend looking at this data without masking out locklosses. From the orange trace you can see that the maximum of the glitches that we have been riding out in low noise has gotten higher recently after drifting somewhat over the run. The next plot shows sort of a glitch rate where I've counted minutes where the FSS fast mon channel goes above 0.6 V as minutes with glitches and haven't made an attempt to try to count how many glitches are happening each minute. Aside: Thanks to Erik and Jonathan for helping me understand why Oli has been having a hard time getting data.

The lower left (bigger) wire is touching the 1/2-20 cap on the body of the shutter. How did this happen you might ask. A combination of a few factors. It's not great that the pins stick out so much from the peek connector. So the nominal pin configuration was to have both of the big pins on the right but the bobbin wire was not long enough for it. This was the case with the previous shutter as well and the old solution was to bend the pin 90 deg which we considered not great. When we left it there was a small space between the cable and the screw head we think because we harped for a bit over how to connect the pins given the interference. Now we realize that it's kinda easy for that cable to relax upwards with small tugs on the cable or even by itself or maybe in the dressing of the cable we moved it a bit and didn't check closely again. ,"{'term': 'L1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73709,anamaria.effler@ligo.org

12296,L1 General - Gravity Spy Glitch Rate Comparison for LLO and LHO between O3 and O4b,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=73703,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Wed, 23 Oct 2024 20:50:06 -0500",Abby Tejera Gabriela GonzalezSummary: We compared the glitch rate per hour in O3 and O4b for LHO and LLO respectively using Gravity Spy data. In LHO Extremely loud is the most common glitch type. Fast scattering has been relatively low for both detectors during O4b. ‘No glitch’ is one of the most common classifications in LHO. While LLO has duplicates in its O4b Gravity Spy data LHO does not.I looked at the available Gravity Spy machine learning algorithm data via LDVW for LLO and LHO in O4b and took data with a Gravity Spy confidence level equal to or greater than 90%. For each detector I compared its O4b data to its O3 data over the same period of time to compare the glitch rate per hour of each glitch class in both observing runs.I took all the O4b data from the start date of the observing run in 2024-04-10 till September and obtained the observing time for that entire period of time (LHO: ~1501 hours LLO: ~2592 hours) in order to get this rate.I did the same for O3 but with the information from the same months that we’ve been observing for O4b so far and I divided it by the observing time of that set of data (LHO: ~2456 hours LLO:~2618 hours) for O3.The results of this comparison for LHO and LLO are attached to this alog in a pdf. In LHO we observe that Extremely Loud is the most common glitch type which is something we had not seen before. Fast scattering during O4b has been relatively low for both detectors this is a big change particularly for LLO as fast scattering used to be one of its most common glitch types in O3.We observe that ‘No glitch’ is within one of the most common glitch classes in LHO but its glitch rate is similar to that of scattered light and low frequency lines so we suspect some of the glitches that are being classified as ‘no glitch’ might actually fall into one of these other two categories (which are additionally within the most common categories in LLO). We will look more into this.Additional notes: The Gravity Spy data for O3 has some duplicates (data corresponding to the same glitch/ GPStime) so when performing these comparisons we always check for any duplicates and eliminate those so that each glitch is considered once. When we did these comparisons for O4a we did not find any duplicates for that observing run. However now that we are performing these calculations for O4b we find duplicates in the Gravity Spy data for LLO. The same is not true for LHO. Because we are using Gravity Spy (the same machine learning algorithm) for our calculations for both detectors and as the duplicates show in LLO and not in LHO (which was not the case during O3) this leads us to suspect that the issue with the duplicates might not be an issue with the algorithm itself but rather something else might create this duplicated data that then is read and classified by Gravity Spy. We will continue to update this comparison as more Gravity Spy data becomes available and will share any updates on the points discussed in this alog.Detchar Non-image files attached to this report O3_O4b_glitch_comparison.pdf ,"{'term': 'L1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73703,abby.tejera@ligo.org

It is interesting that with the old day HEPI bias (different than current floating/locked position) the ITMX optic is in range and capable of going back to the recent locking position ( see figure attached ) ,"{'term': 'L1 SEI', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73688,huyen.pham@ligo.org

ITMY HEPI were unlocked yesterday. There were some ring-ups for both HEPI and ISI which I modified controls to get rid of. Performance is ok. The unlock moved ISI in favor of the ITMY optic (based on OPLEV readouts). The stops were back up in the order: pier 2-1-4-3 (horizontal stops first then vertical ones - H3 IPS had worst readout so it was saved for last). IPS sensor spectra looks ok - V1 is elevated at low frequency (see figure1 ). L4C V4 has low frequency noise but we skip this for now since only position loop will be used. Valve check looks ok ( 1st pdf ). Range of motion looks ok ( figure2 ). Linearity test looks mostly ok ( figure3 ) - could be better with symmetrizartion re-done. H3 and V2 linearity look weird most likely because of the actuators not being centered eventhough IPS readouts are in range. H3 can be explained further in the note below. HEPI ISO X and Y have ~10Hz instability so I reduce the Q as I did for ITMX HEPI. After that ISI RY have 155.5Hz ringings so I notch that in the RY control. The ITMY SEI is now controlled and table performance is comparable with other BSCs (see figure4 ). Note that ETMX RZ low-f elevation is believed caused by faulty GS13 H3 ( alog 70118 ). GV 1&2 were openned yesterday so I had OPLEV to monitor the optic position. The unlock gains ITMY optic range a bit ( figure5 ). Note : H3 IPS (24K counts before unlocking) were railed after HEPI unlocked so I had to move the IPS with one turn on the dial one turn CW (0.5mm?) at 10/22/2024 ~21:16UTC. This brought the H3 down to 17K . The actuator bellow on this pier was already in funny state - one bellow cover (far side) had been removed (see pic6 ). From H3 linearity test the fix maybe recenter the actuator.

For context the ALSY laser had maintenance early today and since then has been having either multimode locking issues or more general laser performance issues according to Daniel. To tackle this Keita and Tony lowered the ALSY locking thresholds in order to make it past ALS and while this worked once was not repeatable. Their alogs: alog 81116 alog 81114 . After some flailing I decided to call for help. Daniel came online and began to dianose the ALSY issues.

The final conclusion is that it's some tuning error where ALSY doesn't operate stably in its current frequency since being adjusted to PSL freq. Daniel's Alog 81117 .

In the past 6 hours good ALS locks (red trace near +1.0) are correlated with the lower green power states. At higher green p[owers we seem to be locking a intermediate transmitted powers indicating the possibility of a multimode laser. The second attached plot shows how changing the frequency of the laser changes the green and red powers.

Locked PMc and SHG took SQZ_OPO_LR to LOCKED (locks on GREEN) Adjusted temperature to maximum seed signal with OPO_IR_PD_LF_OUT got a bit confused here either went past the best temp or locked on a 2nd order mode. Toggle to CLF and re-optimize we got OPO_IR_PD_LF_OUT to ~200e-6 and CLF RF6 increased to -13. We then took SQZ_MANAGER to DOWN and FDS_READY_IFO. Got there with no issues we'll want to re-optimize the temperature right before we go to observing. Starting OPO temp: 31.25.

The first one is plugged into ports 45 & 6 on the PEM patch panel the second is plugged into ports 78 & 9. In the CER T3611670 is plugged into ports 2122 & 23 on PEM ADC5 and T3611672 is plugged into ports 2728 & 29 on PEM ADC4. In the DAQ these channels are H1:PEM-CS_ADC_5_{202122}_2K_OUT_DQ and H1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_{262728}_2K_OUT_DQ. So far the seismometers look like they are giving pretty good data similar to the STS and the old PEM Guralp in the biergarten. The seismometers are oriented so that the ""north"" marking on the their carry handles is pointed down the X-arm as best as I could with eyeballing it. I need to figure out the calibrations but it looks like there is almost exactly -15db difference between these new sensors and the old PEM Guralp but maybe the signal chain isn't exatly the same. Attached images compare the 3T's to the ITMY STS and the existing PEM Guralp in the biergarten. First image compares asds for each seismometer. Shapes are pretty similar below 40 hz but above that they all have very different responses. I don't know what the PEM guralp is calibrated to if anything it looks ~10x lower than the STS (which calibrated to nm/s). The 3T's are about 5x lower than the PEM sensor so ~50x lower than the STS. Second image are tfs for the XY & Z dofs between the 3T's and the STS. These are just passive tfs between the STS and 3T's to see if the have similar response to ground motion These are generally pretty flat between .1 and 10hz. The X & Y dofs seem pretty consistent the Z tfs are different starting around 10hz. I should go and check that the feet are locked and have similar extension. Third image are tfs between the 3T's and the exist PEM Guralp. Pretty similar to the tfs with the STS horizontal dofs all look very similar flat between .1 and 10hz but the ADC4 sensor has a different vertical response. I'll look at noise floors next.

13279,H1 PSL - PSL NPRO Crystal Temperature Tuning,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81107,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 14:38:21 -0800",V. Xu J. Oberling With the PSL NPRO still showing signs of mode hopping after consulting with Sheila via TeamSpeak it was decided to stop locking attempts and go out to the PSL racks to tune the NPRO crystal temperature to see if we could find a mode hop free region. I wasn't too familiar with what we were looking for here but Vicky is so she kindly agreed to lend a hand. We grabbed an oscilloscope from the EE shop some Lemo cables and adapters and out we went. We wanted to scan the PMC through a complete FSR so we could watch the mode content while we changed the NPRO crystal temperature. To do this we unplugged the DC cables for PMC Trans and Refl from the PSL Monitoring Fieldbox and plugged them into the oscilloscope. We also plugged a cable into the 50:1 HV monitor so we could trigger off of the PMC PZT ramp. For the ramp we used the Alignment Ramp on the PMC MEDM screen set to +/- 7V at 1 Hz. Once we got the signals on the scope and successfully triggered we clearly had a full FSR visible so we kept these ramp settings. We watched things for a little bit before starting adjustments and noticed the laser frequency drift a little bit Vicky estimated this at 1-3 GHz in 30 minutes. We began at the crystal temperature where we left it yesterday (25.2 °C) and used the temperature control on the FSS MEDM to step the temperature down. At ~24.85 °C we started to see clear mode hopping behavior in the scan which got worse at 24.75 °C see first attachment. We had originally set the crystal temperature to 24.7 °C so clearly we started in a mode hopping region. We continued moving the temperature down to see where the mode hop region ended the scan didn't start looking good again until ~24.5 °C. We continued moving the temperature down until we maxed the slider. This had the crystal temperature at 23.95 °C and we were still mode hop free. So we started moving the temperature up to start mapping out the upper region (>25.2 °C). When started seeing the bad mode hopping region right above 24.5 °C so this matches with where we saw things on the way down. However it didn't clear up until the temperature was >25.1 °C uncomfortably close to our starting value of 25.2 °C. It looks like the spot we locked the RefCav at yesterday was right on the edge of a mode hopping region and we had been slowly drifting in and out of it. We continued to move the temperature up via the MEDM slider unil it maxed at a crystal temperature of 25.49 °C and saw no mode hopping behavior. The second attachment shows some pictures from both of these good regions. The slider was maxed but we wanted to continue mapping the upper region especially as this area is closer to the operating temperature of the NPRO we just removed from the PSL (meaning the SQZ and ALS lasers had been happily locked in this area for all of O4 to date). To do this we set the slider back to 0 (a crystal temperature of ~24.7 °C) and used the knob on the front panel of the NPRO power supply to adjust the crystal temperature. We moved slowly while watching the power out of the amplifiers and NPRO in case the temperature adjustment caused beam changes that had a negative effect on amp output. In this way we moved the crystal temperature up to 26.75 °C and saw no mode hopping behavior. We did however start to see the power out of the amplifiers drop a little. At a crystal temperature of 26.75 °C we lost roughly 3 mW from the NPRO ~0.5 W from Amp1 and ~1 W from Amp2. 3 mW from the NPRO results in about 0.25 W lost at Amp2 so most of the loss is likely due to mode changes in the NPRO beam caused by the different operating temperature (if this was alignment we would have lost power a good bit faster mode matching changes I've observed are generally a good deal slower than alignment changes). Because of this we stopped here and set the crystal temperature to ~26.27 °C. Still had ~139.0 W output from Amp2 so all is well here. We then plugged everything back in and relocked the PMC it locked without issue. We then adjusted the crystal temperature down via the MEDM slider to find a RefCav resonance. We did have one time where the PMC unlocked when the PZT ran out of range (the PMC PZT moves to keep the PMC locked while the laser frequency changes). We couldn't see a 00 coming through on the PMC ramp so we moved the crystal temperature back up until a 00 was clearly visible flashing through at this point the PMC locked without issue. Continuing to move the temperature down we found a RefCav resonance flash through at a crystal temperature of 26.26 °C so we locked the RefCav. It took a couple of passes to grab the lock (had to disable the FSS Guardian to keep it from yanking the gains around) but it did lock. The final crystal temperature was 26.2 °C. To finish we locked the ISS grabbed our equipment and left the LVEA. We left things here for an hour and saw no signs of mode hopping again so Daniel and Vicky started tuning the ALS and SQZ lasers to match the new NPRO frequency. Time will tell whether or not we are in a better place in regard to NPRO mode hopping but results so far are promising. ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81107,jason.oberling@ligo.org

Once the ISS runs out of power available in the bank (because PMC Refl has increased so much the ISS has drained the bank to try to follow) it unlocks and relocks upone relock it still sees PMC Trans being low so drives the AOM diffraction down until it again runs out of range and unlocks. The cycle repeats until the mode competition stops and PMC Refl returns to its normal ~17.5W. This happened 3 times in 5 hours last night and was happening this morning when I arrived onsite. ,"{'term': 'H1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81099,jason.oberling@ligo.org

It's been a rough shift with issues relocking. Trouble with locking: We had a lockloss from CARM_5_PICOMETERS where it looked like something was being seen in FSS fastmon IMC-TRANS and the ISS_AOM_DRIVER channel for over a minute before the lockloss ( attachment1 )(maybe this is normal and alwys happens during this state?). After this the FSS would not let the IMC lock. There would be giant FSS oscillations in the fastmon channel while PSL_FSS moved between READY_FOR_MC_LOCK and FSS_OSCILLATING ( attachment2 ). Even after it stopped oscillating there were a few quick glitches that were also seen in the IMC ( attachment3 ). Tagging PSL Not completely sure if this is related to the PSL/IMC issues but while running an initial alignment we couldn't get past MICH_BRIGHT_ALIGN and IMC-MC2_TRANS_SUM looked like attachment4 . IMC-TRANS and FSS_FASTMON were oscillating but I'm not sure if that's happening as the issue or as a response to something else. Tagging PSL again sorry :( To solve the problem I took the detector out of initial alignment and waited for everything to calm down (the beamspots and table on the PSL cameras were going crazy) and then continued the IA once that had settled. When we got to ENGAGE_DRMI_ASC/the end of PREP for DRMI before I ran the initial alignment the beam spots on AS AIR would be shaking and the beamsplitter would start saturating and we would either unlock DRMI or lose the lock. I tried adjusting SRM because we were getting through PRMI fine but it just seemed to make it worse so I ran an initial alignment. After that we got up fine without the shaking but after the next lockloss we started having the shaking/saturations again so I ran another initial alignment. No shaking/saturations this time in ENGAGE_DRMI_ASC. Tagging ISC Good news is that we haven't had the new AS AIR PD( 81080 ) PEM-CS_ADC_5_19_2K_OUT_DQ saturate during the last three locklosses! The highest number of counts we've gotten have been around 16k counts. I have also put in a feature request for the integral of the channel's peak at lockloss to be calculated and put onto the lockloss pages and assigned it to me ( Issue#223 ).

OPO TEC temperature adjusted from 31.468 C --> 31.290 C to maximize seed NLG. Change is consistent with last time lho80926 (though not obvious that laser freq changes mean the red/green opo co-resonance should change but ok). Squeezer laser was likely modehopping at the new settings above . Symptoms: - Screenshot of TTFSS beatnote before / after / afterAfter the PSL laser freq change. - PMC_TRANS was 430 (nominal H1:SQZ-PMC_TRANS_DC_POWERMON~675) - PMC_REFL was 370 (nominal H1:SQZ-PMC_REFL_DC_POWERMON~44) - Bad PMC transmission meant not enough SHG power and while OPO could lock the OPO PUMP ISS could not reach the correct pump power. So aside from mode hopping being bad it would have meant bad squeezing. Camilla and I went to the floor. SQZ Laser controller changes made to avoid mode hopping: SQZ Laser current 1.935 A --> 1.885 A SQZ Laser crystal temp 27.02 C --> 27.07 C This adjustment seemed quite sensitive to laser current and crystal temperature with a tunable range kinda less than I expected. Compared to previous SQZ laser adjustments to avoid mode-hopping (see old laser 51238 51135 49500 49327 ) this temperature adjustment seems small for the current (amps) adjustment.. but seemed to work. PMC cavity scans look clean at these new settings (laser looks single-mode) see screenshot . For +/- 200 MHz steps of crystal frequency still see a 160 MHz beatnote.

PD output goes to H1:PEM-CS_ADC_5_19_2K_OUT_DQ for now. GiGE used to receive ~40ppm of the power coming into HAM6. I replaced the steering mirror in front of GigE with 90:10 the camera now receives ~36ppm and the beam going to the photodiode is ~4ppm. But I installed ND1.0 in front of the PD so the actual power on PD is ~0.4ppm. See the attached cartoon (1st attachment) and the picture (2nd attachment). Details: Replaced the HR mirror with 90:10 splitter (BS1-1064-90-1025-45P) roughly kept the beam position on the camera and installed a Thorlabs PDA520 (Si detector ~0.3AW) with OD1.0 absorptive ND filter in the transmission. I set the gain of PDA520 to 0dB (transimpedance=10kOhm). Reflection of the GigE was hitting the mirror holder of 90:10 so I inserted a beam dump there. The beam dump is not blocking the forward-going beam at all (3rd attachment). Reflection of the ND filter hits the black side panel of the enclosure. I thought of using a magnetic base but the enclosure material is non-magnetic. Angling the PD to steer the reflection into the beam dump for GigE reflection is possible but takes time (the PD is in a inconvenient location to see the beam spot). Fil made a custom cable to route power and signal through the unused DB9 feedthrough on the enclosure. Pin 1 = Signal Pin 6 = Signal GND Pin 4 = +12V Pin 5 = -12V Pin 9 = power GND. (However the power GND and signal GND are connected inside the PD.) All pins are isolated from the chamber/enclosure as the 1/2"" metal post is isolated from the PD via a very short (~1/4""?) plastic adapter.

There's a power jump in the NPRO output power (while the FSS was glitching but likely unrelated) followed by a dip in NPRO power that lines up with a ~2W increase in PMC reflected power likely indicating a mode hop. This power excursion was too much of a change out of the PMC for the ISS so the ISS lost lock. Since then there have been small power excursions (up to around 18-19W) but nothing large enough to cause the ISS to give out. As Jason mentioned I've edited the range of ISS diffracted power checked by DIAG_MAIN to be between 2.5% and 5.5% as we'll be running with the ISS at around 4% at least for now. I also checked with Daniel on how to adjust the secondloop tuning to account for this change and he advised that the ISS_SECONDLOOP_REFERENCE_DFR_CAL_OFFSET should be set to be the negative value of the diffracted power percentage so I changed it to be -4.2 and accepted it in SDF.

13312,H1 PSL - PSL Instability Since NPRO Swap,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81073,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Tue, 05 Nov 2024 12:58:45 -0800","R. Short J. Oberling Today we were originally planning to take a look at the TTFSS but noticed something before going into the enclosure that we think is the cause of some of the PSL instability since the completion of the NPRO swap. We were looking at some trends from yesterday's ISS OFF test recreating the plots Ryan C. had made when we noticed the ISS get angry and enter into an unlock/relock cycle that it couldn't get out of. While it was doing this we saw that the PMC Refl power was up around 40W 30W and ""breathing"" with PMC Trans as PMC Refl would increase PMC Trans would decrease but the sum of the 2 was unchanged. We then unlocked the ISS. As we sat and watching things for a bit after the ISS unlock we saw that PMC Refl would change by many Watts as it was breathing. We tried unlocking the IMC the behavior was unchanged we then tried unlocking the FSS RefCav and the behavior was still unchanged. It was at this point we noticed that the moves in PMC Refl were matched by very small moves (1-2 mW) in the NPRO output power as the NPRO output power went up PMC Refl went down and vice versa. This looked a whole lot like the NPRO was mode hopping and 2 or more modes were competing against each other. This would explain the instability we've seen recently. The ISS PDs are located after the PMC so any change in PMC output (like from competing modes) would get a response from the ISS. So if PMC Refl would go up as we had been seeing and PMC Trans drops in response also as we had been seeing the ISS would interpret this as a drop in power and reduce the ISS AOM diffraction in response. When the ISS ran out of range on the AOM diffraction it would then become unstable and unlock it would then try to lock again see it ""needed"" to provide more power run out of range on the AOM and unlock. While this is happening the FSS RefCav TPD would get very noisy and drop as power out of the PMC was dropping. You can see it doing this in the final 3 plots from the ISS OFF test. To give the ISS more range we increased the power bank for the ISS by moving the ISS Offset slider from 3.3 to 4.1 this moved the default diffraction % from ~3% to ~4%. We also increased the ISS RefSignal so when locked the ISS is diffracting ~6% instead of ~2.5%. To try to fix this we unlocked the PMC and moved the NPRO crystal temperature via the FSS MEDM screen to a different RefCav resonance to see if the mode hopping behavior improved. We went up 2 RefCav resonance and things looked OK so we locked the FSS here and then the ISS. After a couple minutes PMC Refl began running away higher and the ISS moved the AOM lower in response until it ran out of range and unlocked. With the increased range on the diffracted power it survived a couple of these excursions but then PMC Refl increased to the point where the ISS emptied its power bank again and unlocked. So we tried moving down by a RefCav resonance (so 1 resonance away from our starting NPRO crystal temperature instead of 2) and it was the same: things looked good locked the stabilization systems and after a couple minutes PMC Refl would run away again (again the ISS survived a couple of smaller excursions but then a large one would empty the bank and unlock it again). So we decided to try going up a 3rd resonance on the RefCav. Again things looked stable so we locked the FSS and ISS here and let it sit for a while. After almost an hour we saw no runaway on PMC Refl so we're going to try operating at this higher NPRO crystal temperature for a bit and see how things go (we went 2 hours with the ISS OFF yesterday and saw nothing so this comes and goes at potentially longer time scales). The NPRO crystal temperature is now 25.2 °C (it started at 24.6 °C) and the temperature control reading on the FSS MEDM screen is now around 0.5 (it was at -0.17 when we started). We have left the ISS Offset at 4.1 and have moved the RefSignal so it is diffracting ~4% this to give the ISS a little more range since we've been seeing it move a little more with this new NPRO (should the crystal temperature change solve the PMC Refl runaway issue we could probably revert this change but I want to keep it a little higher for now). Ryan S. will edit DIAG_MAIN to change the upper limit threshold on the diffracted power % to clear the ""Diffracted power is too high"" alert and Daniel Vicky and Camilla have been re-tuning the SQZ and ALS lasers to match the new PSL NPRO cyrstal temperature. Also the ISS 2nd loop will have to be adjusted to run with this higher diffracted power %. Edit: Corrected the initial high PMC Refl from 40W to 30W. We saw excursions up towards 50W later on as can be seen in the plots Ryan posted below.","{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81073,jason.oberling@ligo.org

IMC/EX Rail/Non-Lockloss Lockloss Investigation: In this order and according to the plots this is what I believe happened. I believe EX saturated prompting IMC to fault while guardian was in DRMI_LOCKED_CHECK_ASC (23:17 PT) putting guardian in a weird fault state but keeping it in DRMI without unlocking (still a mystery). Ryan C noticed this (23:32 PT) and requested IMC_LOCK to DOWN (23:38 PT) tripping MC2’s M2 and M3 (M3 first by a few ms). This prompted Guardian to call me (23:39 PT). What is strange is that even after Ryan C successfully put IMC in DOWN guardian was unable to realize that IMC was in DOWN and STAYED in DRMI_LOCKED_CHECK_ASC until Ryan C requested it to go to INIT. Only after then did the EX Saturations stop. While the EX L3 stage is what saturated before IMC I don’t know what caused EX to saturate like this. The wind and microseism were not too bad so this could definitely be one of the other known glitches happening before all of this causing EX to rail. Here’s the timeline (Times in PT) 23:17: EX saturates. 300ms later IMC faults as a cause of this. 23:32: Ryan C notices this weird behavior in IMC lock and MC2 and texted me. He noticed that IMC lost lock and faulted but that this didn’t prompt an IFO Lockloss. Guardian was still at DRMI_LOCKED_CHECK_ASC but not understanding that IMC is unlocked and EX is still railing. 23:38: In response Ryan C put IMC Lock to DOWN which tripped MC2’s M3 and M2 stages. This called me. I was experiencing technical issues logging in so ventured to site (made it on-site 00:40 UTC). 00:00: Ryan C successfully downed IFO by requesting INIT. Only then did EX stop saturating. 00:40: I start investigating this weird IMC fault. I also untrip MC2 and start an initial alignment (fully auto). We lose lock at LOWNOISE_ESD_ETMX seemingly due to large sus instability probably from the prior railing since current wind and microseism aren’t absurdly high. (EY IX HAM6 and EX saturate). The LL tool is showing an ADS excursion tag. 03:15: NLN and OBSERVING achieved. We got to OMC_Whitening at 02:36 but violins were understandably quite high after this weird issue. Evidence in plots explained: Img 1: M3 trips 440ms before M2. Doesn’t say much but was suspicious before I found out that EX saturated first. Was the first thing I investigated since it was the reason for call (I think). Img 2: M3 and M2 stages of MC2 showing IMC fault beginning 23:17 as a result of EX saturations (later img). All the way until Ryan C downs IMC at 23:38 which is also when the WD tripped and when I was called. Img 3: IMC lock faulting but NOT causing ISC_LOCK to go to lose lock. This plot shows that guardian did not put IFO in DOWN or cause it to lose lock. IFO is in DRMI_LOCKED_CHECK_ASC but IMC is faulting. Even when Ryan C downed the IMC (which is where the crosshair is) this did not cause a ISC to go to DOWN. The end time axis is when Ryan C put IFO in INIT finally causing a Lockloss and ending the railing in EX (00:00). Img 4: EX railing for 42 minutes straight from 23:17 to 00:00. Img 5: Ex beginning to rail 300ms before IMC faults. Img 6: EX L2 and L3 OSEMs at the time of the saturation. Interestingly L2 doesn’t saturate but before the saturation there is erratic behavior. Once this noisy signal stops L3 saturates. Img 7: EX L1 and M0 OSEMs at the time of the saturation zoomed in. It seems that there is a noisy and loud signal (possibly a glitch or due to microseism?) in the M0 stage that is very short which may have kicked off this whole thing. Img 8: EX L1 and M0 OSEMs at the whole duration of saturation. We can see the moves that L1 took throughout the 42 minutes of railing and the two kicks when the railing started and stopped. Img 9 and 10: An OSEM from each stage of ETMX including one extra from M0 (since signals were differentially noisy). Img 9 is zoomed in to try to capture what started railing first. Img 10 shows the whole picture with L3’s railing. I don’t know what to make of this. Further investigation: See what else may have glitched or lost lock first. Ryan C’s induced lockloss saving the constant EX railing doesn’t seem to show up under the LL tool so this would have to be done in order of likely suspects. I’ve never seen this behavior before what this was if anyone else has.

13332,H1 ISC - Calibrated H1/L1 PRCL and MICH coupling comparisons,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81051,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Mon, 04 Nov 2024 13:29:17 -0800",This alog is a continuation of previous efforts to correctly calibrate and compare the LSC couplings between Hanford and Livingston. Getting these calibrations right has been a real pain and there's a chance that there could still be an error in these results. These couplings are measured by taking the transfer function between DARM and the LSC CAL CS CTRL signal. All couplings were measured without feedforward. The Hanford measurements were taken during the March 2024 commissioning break. The Livingston MICH measurement is from Aug 29 2023 and the PRCL measurement from June 23 2023. As an additional note during the Hanford MICH measurement both MICH and SRCL feedforward were off. However for the Livingston MICH measurement SRCL feedforward was on. For the PRCL measurements at both sites both MICH and SRCL feedforward were engaged. Results: The first plot attached shows a calibrated comparison between the MICH PRCL and SRCL couplings at LHO. The second plot shows a calibrated comparison between the Hanford and Livingston MICH couplings. I also included a line indicating 1/280 an estimated coupling level for MICH based on an arm cavity finesse of 440. Both sites have flat coupling between about 20-60 Hz. There is a shallow rise in the coupling above 60 Hz. I am not sure if that's real or some artifact of incorrect calibration. The Hanford coupling below 20 Hz has steeper response which appears like some cross coupling between SRCL perhaps (it looks about 1/f^2 to me). Maybe this is present because SRCL feedforward was off. The third plot shows a calibrated comparison between the Hanford and Livingston PRCL couplings. I have no sense of what this coupling should look like. If the calibration here is correct this indicates that the PRCL coupling at Hanford is about an order of magnitude higher than Livingston. Whatever coupling is present has a different response between both sites so I don't really know what to make of this. Calibration notes: The Hanford measurements used H1:CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ and the darm calibration from March 2024 ( /ligo/groups/cal/H1/reports/20240311T214031Z/deltal_external_calib_dtt.txt ) The Livingston measurement used L1:OAF-CAL_DARM_DQ and a darm calibration that Dana Jones used in her previous work ( 74787 saved in /ligo/home/dana.jones/Documents/cal_MICH_to_DARM/L1_DARM_calibration_to_meters.txt) LHO MICH calibration: I updated the CAL CS filters to correctly match the current drive filters. However I made the measurement in March 11 before catching some errors in the filters. I incorrectly applied a 200:1 filter and multiplied by sqrt(1/2) when I should have multipled by sqrt(2) ( 76261 ). Therefore my calibration includes a 1:200 filter and a factor of 2 to appropriately compensate for these mistakes. Additionally my calibration includes a 1e-6 gain to convert from um to m and an inverted whitening filter [100 100:1 1]. This is all saved in a DTT template: /ligo/home/elenna.capote/LSC_calibration/MICH_DARM_cal.xml LLO MICH calibration: I started with Dana Jones' template ( 74787 ) and copied it over into my directory: /ligo/home/elenna.capote/LSC_calibration/LLO_MICH.xml. I inverted the whitening filter using [100100100100100:11111] and applied a gain of 1e-6 to convert um to m. LHO PRCL calibration: I inverted the whitening using [100100:11] and converted from um to m with 1e-6. LLO PRCL calibration: I inverted the whitening using [101010:111] and converted from um to m with 1e-6. I exported the calibrated traces to plot myself.

Short I've updated the PSL_FSS Guardian so that it won't jump into the FSS_OSCILLATING state whenever there's just a quick glitch in the FSS_FAST_MON_OUTPUT channel. Whenever the FSS fastmon channel is over its threshold of 0.4 the FSS_OSCILLATION channel jumps to 1 and the PSL_FSS Guardian responds by dropping the common and fast gains to -10 dB then stepping them back up to what they were before. This is meant to catch when there's a servo oscillation in the FSS but it's also been happening when the FSS glitches. Since moving the gains around makes it difficult for the IMC to lock the Guardian should now only do that when there's an actual oscillation and should save time relocking the IMC.

When I found it the SQZ angle (as controlled by H1:SQZ-CLF_RF6_PHASE_PHASEDEG) was railed at 268 deg whereas normally the RF6 demod phase is around 195 degrees. Because the known SQZ angle to ASC coupling the ADF Angle servo running away could likely cause ASC to run away which causes LO loop not to lock and then FC-IR can't lock. Ryan cleared ASC as he described above TO-DO for us next week: We should clean up what the SQZ ASC clearing does. First I manually walked ZM6 P/Y to get some signal on OMC RF3 TRANS (manually walked the RF3_MON up from -22 to -10 or so). Then I was able to lock the LO loop (LO loop was railing when SQZ ASC had it totally misaligned). Then I manually enabled SQZ AS42 ASC and it worked to align ZM4/6 to maximize RF3_MON. I then adjusted OPO temperature to optimize RF6_ABS see screenshot . Here I just wanted to make sure the OPO temperature being wrong did not cause the SQZ angle to be wrong which in turn could've caused ASC to run away. After locking the LO loop then SQZ_MANAGER to FREQ_DEP_SQZ worked and SQZ_FC locked successfully. But FC ASC did not turn on because FC was misaligned (the issue described above). I manually lowered FC ASC trigger threshold (FC_ASC screen > TRIG: I lowered H1:SQZ-FC_ASC_TRIGGER_THRESH_ON from nominal 3 to 1.5) in order to force FC_ASC to turn on and align FC1 and FC2 for us. Then I reverted the SDF's on FC_INJ_ANG_{GAINTRAMP} which (I didn't realize) then applied the FC_ASC offsets stored in the filter bank histories to ZM3. This was good actually. Restoring this ZM3 alignment restored the FC_REFL power. Then all SDF's were clear and Ryan could go to observe. ,"{'term': 'H1 SQZ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81030,victoriaa.xu@ligo.org

In order to better see the values around high coherence we are plotting 1 - coherence and using a logarithmic scale. So to the left higher coherence and to the right lower coherence.There are two plots in each PDF for coherences with CALIB_STRAIN (left plots) and CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN (right plots).Each plot shows for each channel the coherence value before the broadening (black circles) and after (red diamonds) using the same 2h intervals as the plots from Wednesday and fftlength 64 s.Note that due to the ""M"" behaviour explained in the previous comment most channels in the GDS-CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN 60 Hz peak before the broadening have higher coherence surrounding 60 Hz than just at 60 Hz.What we observe is that most channel have a similar coherence value with some exceptions but there is no 1 channel with a much higher coherence than the rest.

What we have done is the following: - We have chosen 2 hour length data segments before and after the 60 Hz broadening for both detectors. For Livingston this is 10:00–12:00 Sept 17th vs 2:30–4:30 Sept 18. For Hanford 2:00–4:00 Oct 1st vs 8:00–10:00 Oct 2nd. - Then we launched FscanDriver with fftlenght 64s of these data segments in order to obtain Coherence and AMP PSD (not normalized) data to plot. The channels that we have analysed are the MAG channels plus the nine MAINSMON channels. Both for Livingston and Hanford. The coherence has been computed with both H1(L1):GDS-CALIB_STRAIN and H1(L1):GDS-CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN - With the data we have made 3 plots for each channel. The first one shows the coherence before and after of the channel with H1:GDS-CALIB_STRAIN the second the coherence before and after with H1:GDS-CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN and the third one the AMPPSD before and after the broadening.The conclusions are as follows: - The changes we see in AMPPSD do not seem to be large. However we see larger shoulders afterwards in the following channels (attaching the plots): - H1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_INPUTOPTICS_X Y Z_DQ - H1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_VERTEX_Y_DQ changing while the X and Z do not. - L1_PEM-EY_MAG_VEA_FLOOR_X Y Z_DQ - The coherence plots with GDS-CALIB_STRAIN don't show much difference before and after. - The coherence plots with GDS-CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN do show a large difference before and after. Before the broadening in both detectors there is an ""M"" in the shape of the coherence with a valley at 60 Hz and large shoulders at each side. These shoulders seem much broader in L1 than in H1. In the after broadening however this valley and shoulders appear to have disappeared. This appears to be because in the after plots the broadening cloaks the coherence with the shoulders. Furthermore these shoulders appear in the GDS-CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN and not the GDS-CALIB_STRAIN indicating that the calibration has caused coherence with the shoulders that is not there before calibration.Attaching some representative plots plus the channels mentioned above.

13430,L1 General - Observations for the very loud glitches are consistent with a scatterer near the ERM PDs,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=73865,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Sun, 03 Nov 2024 16:55:23 -0600",[Tabata Gaby] We used the correlation found by OmegaScan between CALIB_STRAIN and the ERM PDs for loud glitches to see whether the glitches are seen by PD in both arms just one or neither. We had observed that according to OmegaScan there were more photodiodes (PDs) in the y-arm than in the x-arm showing larger correlations ( alog 73447 ). However some large correlation values had also large standard deviations. We modified the OmegaScan analysis from comparing correlations between the x and y arm ERM PDs to correlation divided by standard deviation. With this we can conclude that 70% of the DARM glitches with large SNR (> 300) were found to be predominantly correlated with either the X arm or the Y arm. In most cases at least three PDs showed correlations. In contrast most of those with lower SNR exhibited no correlation with any arm. Figure 1 presents correlation/standard deviation versus glitch number with the glitches sorted by SNR in descending order meaning glitch #0 has the largest SNR (~12000) while glitch #199 has the lowest (~182). The horizontal line in the image represents the threshold established for indicating correlation. We also found instances of correlation involving both arms. After analyzing these cases we noted that one arm exhibited a significantly lower SNR compared to the other. Upon examining their raw time series we observed that signals from the photodiodes in the high-SNR arm exhibited a spike in their signal (indicating more light on the PD) while those in the other arm showed a slight decrease of light. This is consistent with a scatterer near the ERM PDs in one arm producing the spike with the loud glitch in DARM causing a minor power drop in both arms which manifests as a small decrease in the other arm’s PDs (and in the transmission monitors PDs as well). An example can be seen in Figure 2 where there is a spike in the signal in Y-arm PD and a decrease in X-arm PD. Signals were high-passed with a 3 Hz corner frequency.

The 300 gain shows double the contributions as the 600 around 9hz. This may be because the code normalizes the contributions based on the injections. Since this strange 9Hz seem to be comming from another source than the injections it got halved in the 600 plot in comparison to the 300.

Both of this and the previous lockloss look PSL-related (ie upstream of IMC- which does see power fluctuations earlier than suggested by the IMC_TRANS channel). Might be worth trying whether the IMC can stay locked with the ISS_ON vs. ISS_OFF tests again now that the PSL laser is not obviously mode hopping. This lockloss maybe looks strange: see 20-ms trends 1-second trends 5-second trends. It looks like a very fast lockloss (< 1ms) coincident with various FSS/ISS/TPD glitches - is this different than what we saw before? Here AS port loses light within like < 1 ms (as witnessed on Keita's new lockloss monitor AS_A and LSC-REFL which sees some corresponding power increase). Lockloss looks within 1ms of changes in PSL-FSS TPD FAST_MON PC_MON and ISS AOM SECONDLOOP etc. Weirdly IMC-TRANS_IN1_DQ (fast channel 16k) does not see power change until 5 ms later which I don't understand? I think like DARM loses lock (which should be why AS port and LSC-REFL both change inversely right?) while the power on IMC-TRANS doesn't change despite the PSL FSS and ISS loops all see glitches. Daniel suggested maybe there could be some more analog filtering on IMC-TRANS slows down this channel (even though it is recorded at 16k?) - we're not sure why there is such a delay and whether this IMC-TRANS channel a super reliable timing metric for what is happening. The ~5ms seems too fast for the storage time given IMC's ~8.8 kHz cavity pole (1/(2*pi*8.8kHz) ~ 18 microseconds). Daniel helped add some fast PSL-ISS_SECONDLOOP channels to the Sheila's scopes and I've added Keita's lockloss monitor channel too ( 81080 H1:PEM-CS_ASC_5_19_2K_OUT_DQ ) then saved this scope at /ligo/home/victoriaa.xu/ndscope/PSL/PSL_lockloss_search_fast_iss.yaml Lockloss ,"{'term': 'H1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81155,victoriaa.xu@ligo.org

Camilla and I checked this out today and it turns out that these locklosses are actually from LOCKING_ARMS_GREEN - the checker in READY that is supposed to make sure the IMC is locked was actually written as nodes['IMC_LOCK'] == 'LOCKED' (line 947) which just checks that the requested state for IMC_LOCK is LOCKED and it doesn't actually make sure the IMC is locked. So READY will return True it will continue to LOCKING_ARMS_GREEN and immediately lose lock because LOCKING_ARMS_GREEN actually makes sure the IMC is locked. This all happens so fast that verbals doesn't have time to announce LOCKING_ARMS_GREEN before we are taken to DOWN. To (hopefully) solve this problem we changed nodes['IMC_LOCK'] == 'LOCKED' to be nodes['IMC_LOCK'].arrived and nodes['IMC_LOCK'].done and this should make sure that we stay in READY until the IMC is fully locked.

It seems that the fast shutter after it was shut bounced down to momentarily unblock the AS beam at around the time the power peaked. For this specific lock loss the energy deposited into HAM6 was about 17J and the energy that got passed the fast shutter is estimated to be ~12J because of the bouncing. Bouncing motion was known to exist for some time (e.g. alogs 79104 and 79397 the latter has an in-air slow-mo video showing the bouncing) it seems as if the self damping is not working. Could this be an electronics issue or mechanical adjustment issue or something else? Also if we ever open HAM6 again (before this fast shutter is decomissioned) it might be a good idea to make the shutter unit higher (shim?) so the beam is still blocked when the mirror reaches its lowest position while bouncing up and down. Details: The top panel shows the newly installed lockloss power monitor (blue) and ASC-AS_A_DC_NSUM which monitors the power downstream of the fast shutter (orange). The shutter was triggered when the power was ~3W or so at around t~0.36 and the ASC-AS_C level drops by a factor of ~1E4 immediately ( FS mirror spec is T<1000ppm seems like it's ~100ppm in reality). However 50ms later at t~0.41 or so the shutter bounced back down and stayed open for about 15ms. Unfortunately this roughly coincided with the time when the power coming into HAM6 reached its maximum of ~760W. Green is a rough projection of the power that went to OMC (aka ""AS_A_DC_NSUM would have looked like this if it didn't rail"" trace). This was made by simply multiplying the power mointor itself with AS_A_DC_NSUM>0.1 (1 if true 0 if false) ignoring the 2nd and 3rd and 4th bouncing. All in all for this specific lock loss the energy coming to HAM6 was 16~17J and the energy that got past FS was about 11~12J because the timing of the bounce VS the power. OMC seems to be protected by the PZT though see the 2nd attachemt with wider time range The time scale of the lock loss spike itself doesn't seem that different from the L1 lock loss in LLO alog 73514 where the power coming to HAM6 peaked tens of ms after AS_A/B/C power appreciably increased. OMC DCPDs might be OK since they didn't record crazy high current (though I have to say the IN1 should have been constantly railing once we started losing lock which makes the assessment difficult) and since we've been running with bouncy FS and the DCPDs have been good so far. Nevertheless we need to study this more. ISC ","{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81130,keita.kawabe@ligo.org

We followed the procedure in LIGO-T1400486 to test the performance of the OFS board and everything seemed normal. We centered the beam on the OFS PD in the transmitter module and used the REFL output beam on the PS4 (WSH) power standard to set the loop offset to 3.94 V (V2 on the HP power supply)which gave 300 mW in the REFL beam. We then measured the OFS OLTF (Souce at CLTF TEST IN PD MON / ERR MON) and set the gain at 7.60 V (V1 on the HP power supply) to give a UGF of 100 kHz. The phase margin is about 55 deg as expected.

So far it looks like: This problem is distinct from the 60 Hz broadening due to issues with line subtraction (this noise feature shows up in DELTAL_EXTERNAL). CS microphone and accelerometer channels look suspicious particularly H1:PEM-CS_MIC_LVEA_BS_DQ but the noise shows up earlier there than in DARM. If it is the same noise something must have changed with the coupling during the break. The attached plots are all generated from Fscan weekly and monthly averaged data. The feature can be seen most clearly in these long-duration spectra. Fig 1: Comparison of October monthly spectra STRAIN_CLEAN vs DELTAL_EXTERNAL. The location of interest is marked with a vertical pink line (this marker is actually too narrow just showing general location). The 60 Hz broadening described in 80624 mostly hides the bump in STRAIN_CLEAN but it's still evident in DELTAL_EXTERNAL. Fig 2: Comparison of spectrograms made from weekly averages STRAIN_CLEAN vs DELTAL_EXTERNAL. The region of interest is circled in red. This seems consistent with the timeline Keith reported in 79897 . (Note: The colorbars here are not equivalent and have been adjusted for visibility. Some small data gaps are due to broken Fscan production jobs which may differ by channel.) Fig 3: Same as Fig 2 but zoomed in and with slightly different color bar adjustment. Fig 4: The DELTAL_EXTERNAL zoom from Fig 3 compared with data from H1:PEM-CS_MIC_LVEA_BS_DQ . The tracks appear similar but the noise in H1:PEM-CS_MIC_LVEA_BS_DQ predates its appearance in DARM. It doesn't show up in coherence between the two channels.

There is some evidence that there is extra noise from this compared to end station HEPIs but we will do more tests especially ITMY HEPI to compare better. The first plot shows the injections we did compared to the DARM bands. The noise can show up all the way to high frequency but this might not be too worrisome since we're injecting a lot. The second plot shows the DARM spectra comparison for these tests. The most interesting part is injecting at microseism frequencies. We injected on HEPI at 0.2 Hz observed the ISI signal and then injected on the ISI to match that amplitude. That should tell us if we can distinguish between what's hanging just from HEPI (the ACB) and what's hanging from the ISI (everything else). It seems that the HEPI injection has higher amplitude in DARM at 10-15 Hz and is so far the closest signal we've had to the amplitude we see during microseism fringing. To remind people: Huyen has been on a mission to shake all ISIs and available HEPIs at microseism to check which one could have high enough light amplitude to explain the noise we see. We also did a sweep from 0.2 to 0.5 Hz . It shows some signal in DARM around 0.45 Hz but that might simply be because we're driving the quad resonance so we have do further investigations on this (the ASC signals were large as the sweep went through that freqeuncy). This test is a little confusing because we expect that whatever the source of microseism may be it should couple at all frequencies but the spectrograms are a little less telling that the direct integrated spectra so maybe it's not quite the right way to test. Next steps: - shake ITMY HEPI the same way - do a careful cross comparison with other ISI and HEPI injections - check how much we are injecting versus the seismic signals during microseism noise - try other degrees of freedom not just longitudinal.

See aLogs 68999 69034 70426 71323 71786 73689 for background and discussion. The attached document focuses on a comparison of an 8 hour period on 2 Nov 2024 where no BNS range oscillations are visible and one on 19 Sep 2024 when the oscillations are prominent. For the latter the first 40% or so of the 8 hours shows no visible oscillations followed by strong oscillations for the remainder of that time. The observed properties are introduced using 19 Sep showing the BNS range the “equipment room” temperature and ground motion illustrated in a variety of frequency ranges. When oscillations are visible in the auxiliary channels an overlay of the BNS range is provided. On 19 Sep the EX AHU channels were of three types: (1) channels that displayed the no-oscillation followed by oscillation as shown by the range (2) channels that oscillated through the 8 hour period and (3) channels that were either constant or varied without oscillating. Only channels of type (1) from 19 Sep are shown in the comparison with those of 2 Nov. Unfortunately no patterns have been noticed (at least by me) in the comparison. One might expect the vertical scales to be different from each other on the two days. For most channels that is not the case.

IFO was in MAINTENANCE wind gusts were over 30mph and microseism was very high (troughs higher than 90% line and peaks higher than 100% line for secondary). For the second third of shift I was attempting to lock since winds calmed down but got caught up during initial alignment since SRM WD M3 would trip incessantly during SRC align which I assume is due to the microseism being so high since this doesn't normally happen and it's the primary unique condition. After initial alignment finished IFO reached NLN fully automatically. After an SDF diff clearance (attached) we were observing for a whole 27 minutes! For the third third of shift I was attempting to relock following a Lockloss ( alog 81215 ) caused by a 50mph wind gust that even my less-than-LIGO-sensitive ears could detect. I also confirmed it wasn't the PSL. I waited in DOWN until the gusts got back below 30mph and attempted to relock. The PSL glitch happened a few times in between (since IMC was faulting but winds were low) but we got all the way to FIND_IR until another 38mph gust came though.

I trended the various ETMX ETMY and ITMX suspension channels during these transitions. The first two attachments here show a side by side set of scopes with the left showing a successful transition from Nov 10 and the right showing a failed transition from Nov 9. It appears that in both cases the ITMX L3 drive has a ~1 Hz oscillation that grows in magnitude until the transition. Both the good and bad times show a separate oscillation right at the transition. This occurs right at the end of state 557 so the locklosses within 1 or 2 seconds of state 558 likely are resulting from whatever the of the steps in state 557 do. The second screenshot zooms in to highlight that the successful transition has a different oscillation that rings down whereas the unsuccessful transition fails right where this second ring up occurs. I grabbed a quick trend of the microseism and it looks like the ground motion approximately doubled around Sept 20 (third screenshot). I grabbed a couple of recent successful and unsuccessful transitions since Sept 20 and they all show similar behavior. A successful transition from Sept 19 (fourth attachment) does not show the first 1 Hz ring up just the second fast ring down after the transition. I tried to look back at a time before the DAC change at ETMX but I am having trouble getting any data that isn't minute trend. I will keep trying for earlier times but this already indicates an instability in this transition that our long ramp times are not avoiding. ,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81202,elenna.capote@ligo.org

With Camilla's help I looked through the lockloss tool to see if these are related to the IMC locklosses or not. ""TRANSITION_FROM_ETMX"" and ""LOWNOISE_ESD_ETMX"" are states 557 and 558 respectively. For reference transition from ETMX is the state where DARM control is shifted to IX and EY and the ETMX bias voltage is ramped to our desired value. Then control is handed back over the EX. Then in lownoise ESD some low pass is engaged and the feedback to IX and EY is disengaged. In total since the start of O4b (April 10) there have been 26 locklosses from ""transition from ETMX"" 14 of which have been since the vent recovery on Aug 21 5 of these locklosses are tagged ""IMC"" all occuring on or after October 4. The first lockloss in this state since the vent recovery occured on Sept 13 There is a variety of state duration times in these locklosses ranging from 4 seconds to 2 minutes 57 seconds most of these locklosses before and after the vent have additional tags such as ""windy"" ""earthquake"" etc. Only three appear to have only ""refined"" as a tag From the start of O4b (April 10) to now there have been 22 locklosses from ""lownoise ESD ETMX"" 5 of these occured before the vent none are tagged as IMC All but two of the locklosses occured with state durations between 1-3 seconds in the state before the vent the 5 locklosses have additional tags besides ""refined"" such as ""OMC DCPD"" or ""WINDY"". After the vent most of the locklosses are only tagged as ""refined"". Since the vent one of these locklosses occured on Aug 23 the rest have occurred on or after Sept 27 Trending the microseismic channels the microseism increases seems to correspond with the worsening of this lockloss rate for lownoise ESD ETMX.

Then I disenaged the 10 Hz pole and engaged the digital gain to run the ISS injections (low medium and high frequency). I was fiddling with the IMC WFS pitch injection template to get it to higher frequency for a jitter injection when we lost lock.

We don't use this sensor in loop but it is nice to have L4C witness on HEPI during PEM injections so the plan was swaping this bad sensor out. To access vertical L4C on BSC HEPI one would need to move the HEPI locking plate that is above the actuator and the L4C V-block. Apparently unplug and replug the cable at the sensor fixed the L4C V4 noise issue see ( fig1 - lower right plot with reference trace is when it was bad) I also attemped to fix IPS V1 (low-f noise) but couldn't yet. We narrowed it down to be the electronics chain by switching the pier cables at the input of the AA chassis but we encoutered weird behavior. (1) I unpluged chain from I/O chassis to see ADC noise and they all seemed ok. (2) I then replaced the HEPI AA chassis (twice!) thinking this was the noise source but the noise kept coming back to the same level. (3) Replacing ADC cable also did not help.

The last time the AS port sensors were thoroughly investigated to decouple DHARD/MICH/SRC angular controls was in 2018 [ 37944 and 38148 ] and it is unclear to me if any changes were actually made with maybe some phasing tweaks done since. The 2.7 Hz coupling into DHARD_Y [ which I did preliminary hunting for in aLog 73035 ] which occasionally creates noise in the loop due to degraded phase margin can be seen in all of the ASC controls for those three collections of degrees of freedom (DOFs) DHARD/MICH/SRC Pitch/Yaw. I plot Power Spectra/Coherence/Transfer Functions between these DOFs and DHARD_Y searching for glaring signs of sensing cross coupling [ @56W input power @72W input power ]. There is strong coherence between the DHARD_Y signal and most of the SRC{12}_{P.Y} signals. I believe there is considerable cross coupling in the sensing affecting these loops in the band 1.5-3.5 Hz. The SRC2_{PY} loops only actuate to the M1 stage of the SRM in our present configuration so I suspect these are merely witnesses. The SRC1_{PY} loops drive the SR2 at the M2 stage so any sensed motion is in loop. (Pitch is the biggest offender interestingly). Using DQ data I have traced the onset of this increase in (apparent) coupling between DHARD_Y and SRC2 to the CHARD_Y/DHARD_Y compensation filter change in Feb2024[ 69894 ]. Effects of the filter change [ Screenshot ] is a considerable coherent noise degradation seen in SRC2_Y and SRC1_P. Oddly enough there was little to no change in the filters around 2.7 Hz and I worry something else was changed at the same time that is impacting this coupling. Other than re-doing the AS port sensing matrix nothing comes to mind going forward at the moment. PS There is also considerable cross coupling with noise around 0.4 Hz potentially introducing further unwarned dynamics. ,"{'term': 'L1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73994,vladimir.bossilkov@ligo.org

What happened was that PRMI was poorly aligned (POP18 and 90 I ERR both below 20 counts) but PRMI was able to grab lock for a couple of seconds but would not hold lock as the guardian engaged the top mass offloading adjsuted gains and filters. Eventually this hit the timer in H1 manager to do an initial alignmemt after just over an hour. There is also a timer in ISC that checks if PRMI hasn't locked in 10 minutes it should move onto MICH fringes. This didn't happen in this case because of the very short locks. Ryan and I read through the ISC_LOCK AQUIRE_PRMI state and realized that it had a check (line 1371) for DRMI arrived (in the state PRMI locked) which didn't include a check for the state being done which would return true in ISC LOCK before ISC_DRMI finished the final steps in PRMI locked . In the second zoomed screenshot you can see that as soon as the DRMI guardian enters state 35 (PRMI locked) ISC lock moves on immediately from state 50 (ACQUIRE PRMI) to 51 and 52 (PRMI ASC) which resets the timer so that we never went to MICH fringes. We added a check for the ISC_DRMI state to be both arrived and done in PRMI locked so that PRMI will have to survive the offloading and boost engagement for the timer to be reset. Ibrahim has now reloaded this. We think that if this situation came up again now we would only spend 10 minutes relocking PRMI before going to MICH fringes. If H1 is under the manager control it would run initial alignment if running MICH fringes didn't help. ,"{'term': 'H1 GRD', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81298,sheila.dwyer@ligo.org

Ibrahim looked at the long time between the earthquake and relocking about an hour of that was waiting in ready for the ground motion to come down (which the guardian does independently now) then Ibrahim saw that there were 20 something PRMI locklosses in a row all about 2 seconds after PRMI locked. (We will look into this more) We also looked back at Corey's shift and think that lockloss during the ETM transitions at 2:05 was not a PSL/IMC glitch (noted as LOCK #2 in Corey's alog).

14426,H1 PEM - TCS-Y chiller is likely hurting Crab sensitivity,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81246,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 18:06:20 -0800",Ansel reported that a peak in DARM that interfered with the sensitivity of the Crab pulsar followed a similar time frequency path as a peak in the beam splitter microphone signal. I found that this was also the case on a shorter time scale and took advantage of the long down times last weekend to use a movable microphone to find the source of the peak. Microphone signals don’t usually show coherence with DARM even when they are causing noise probably because the coherence length of the sound is smaller than the spacing between the coupling sites and the microphones hence the importance of precise time-frequency paths. Figure 1 shows DARM and the problematic peak in microphone signals. The second page of Figure 1 shows the portable microphone signal at a location by the staging building and a location near the TCS chillers. I used accelerometers to confirm the microphone identification of the TCS chillers and to distinguish between the two chillers (Figure 2). I was surprised that the acoustic signal was so strong that I could see it at the staging building - when I found the signal outside I assumed it was coming from some external HVAC component and spent quite a bit of time searching outside. I think that this may be because the suspended mezzanine (see photos on second page of Figure 2) acts as a sort of soundboard helping couple the chiller vibrations to the air. Any direct vibrational coupling can be solved by vibrationally isolating the chillers. This may even help with acoustic coupling if the soundboard theory is correct. We might try this first. However the safest solution is to either try to change the load to move the peaks to a different frequency or put the chillers on vibration isolation in the hallway of the cinder-block HVAC housing so that the stiff room blocks the low-frequency sound. Reducing the coupling is another mitigation route. Vibrational coupling has apparently increased so I think we should check jitter coupling at the DCPDs in case recent damage has made them more sensitive to beam spot position. For next generation detectors it might be a good idea to make the mechanical room of cinder blocks or equivalent to reduce acoustic coupling of the low frequency sources.

This required putting a shortcut to the EPICS IOC startup script in the C:\TwinCAT\3.1\Target\StartUp directory (see attached screenshots) and selecting an option in the TwinCAT Visual Studio project to autostart the TwinCAT runtime. We software restarted the computer again to test this and after logging in the Beckhoff runtime and PLC code started along with the EPICS IOC but the visualization did not. I found documentation that pointed to the location of the executable that starts the visualization and added a shortcut to that to the startup directory as well.

The micron displacement in P amounts to 60ct/day of drift which is slightly worse than prev. In general this is about 6x more drift than the previous config but 1/3 the drift of our past more drifty configs. First Look Findings: There is a YAW drift in the current config compared with previous which is somewhat understandable since blade movements at the top stage risk YAW displacement but why is it drifting and not just an offset? There is slightly more F1/P drift in the current config than the previous but I would consider it largely minimal compared to the general amount of drift we've seen in other configurations. ,"{'term': 'X1 SUS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81253,ibrahim.abouelfettouh@ligo.org

Oberling R. Short M. Pirello F. Clara Several PSL items during yesterday's maintenance day: Take TFs of PSL stabilization systems to see where things stand before we start removing things Especially want to check if the apparent EOM resonance peak noted here in the FSS (~1.68MHz) moves with Common gain changes as we would expect Remove in-service TTFSS (SN LHO01) for characterization in the EE shop for preparing working spares and checking for not functional components Test spare TTFSS (SN LHO03) to see if it will lock the RefCav after Marc found several gain issues since the previous test Check ISS AOM RF input connection for tightenss after a suggestion from Tony based on observations seen in PCal AOMs Wire Amp2 power monitor PD to a higher data rate channel (was currently only going to PSL Beckhoff and read into EPICS at 16Hz) Summary Took TFs all looked good FSS Common gain moves the 1.68MHz peak as expected Found ISS AOM RF cable loose re-tightened it with an SMA torque wrench Wired Amp2 power monitor PD to a faster data rate channel H1:PSL-PWR_HPL_DC_OUT_DQ Tested and characterized in-service TTFSS SN LHO01 found and replaced a bad PA85 op amp Tested spare TTFSS SN LHO03 would lock RefCav but would oscillate for a couple minutes before calming down unit has less gain than LHO01 Tuned notches in TTFSS SN LHO01 reinstalled and locked RefCav Details To start we took PMC ISS and FSS transfer functions. The PMC and ISS (1st and 2nd attachments respsectively) look as we had set them at the end of the NPRO swap. The FSS looked as left after lowering the Common gain to 13dB on Nov 1st with the marker on the 1.68MHz peak (3rd attachment) we raised the Common gain to 15dB and saw the peak raise by 2dB as we expect. I didn't get a picture of it but we also lowered the Common gain by 2dB to 11dB and saw the 1.68MHz peak also lower by 2dB also as we expect. Next we wired the Amp2 power monitor PD to an EPICS channel with a faster data rate we used the old High Power Laser (HPL) channel from the HPO days which was still alive and well (and already had a fitting name). We ran a cable to the Lemo tee used to wire the PD to the PSL Sensor Interface Chassis and plugged this cable into the HPL DC port of the PSL Monitoring Fieldbox. We then recalibrated this channel to match the power reading from PSL Beckhoff this required a change in the channel gain from 0.0160515 to 0.047732. The full channel name is H1:PSL-PWR_HPL_DC_OUT_DQ and the data rate is 16kHz. Next we checked the ISS AOM RF connection after a suggestion from Tony (he said they had seen weird AOM glitches in PCal in the past and when this happened they found the RF cable had managed to work itself loose by upwards of half a turn). The ISS was turned OFF the ISS AOM driver was turned OFF the PMC unlocked and the PSL external shutter closed. Using an SMA torque wrench I attempted to tighten the SMA connection to the ISS AOM I found it loose by ~3/4 of a turn. I hadn't considered checking this connection before but after this we will check all of our SMA connections regularly to make sure they are tight (PSL EOM ISS AOM LO and PD inputs on the TTFSS box). At this time I also noted new component locations on the PSL table as a result of the NPRO swap (FI replacement new mode matching solution etc.) so I can update the As-Built PSL table drawing. We also took the opportunity to re-center the Bullseye PD (uses the leakage beam from M10 the first mirror after the ISS AOM) as we had forgot to do this at the end of the NPRO swap. We then removed the in-service TTFSS box SN LHO01 for testing/characterization in the EE shop. Once Fil turned off the high voltage we removed the TTFSS box and took it to the lab where Marc started testing the individual signal paths. Both the Common and PZT paths of the TTFSS looked as expected based on Marc's modeling of the TTFSS circuit but the higher frequency portion of the EOM path looked completely wrong. Marc has all of this data that he can post once he has it in a readable format. The EOM path features 2 op amps in parallel that drive the EOM an AD829 and a PA85. Marc checked the AD829 path and all looked good there so it looked like the PA85 had gone dodgy. I recall in the past when the PA85 blew the FSS either went completely unstable with wall-to-wall oscillations in the PZT path that could not be cured (as noted the last time a PA85 blew in 2019 ) or would not lock the RefCav at all this is completely different behavior than what we have been seeing so we did not suspect the PA85 until Marc took a TF of the TTFSS EOM path. We then began a hunt for a spare PA85 and eventually found 3 of them. We swapped the dodgy PA85 with one of the spares (we now have 2 left) and Marc took the EOM path TF again now all looked as expected based on the models so Marc continued characterizing the in-service TTFSS. While Marc continued characterizing TTFSS SN LHO01 we took the Rev B spare unit SN LHO03 and installed it to see if it could lock the RefCav. Recall that the last time this unit was tested the RefCav would lock but had very large PZT oscillations that never went away Marc subsequently found multiple resistors that were the wrong values (as per the circuit documentation) which would cause gain issues and likely instability in the control loop. Now that Marc had fixed these issues we wanted to test the unit again. With Fil helping with the high voltage we installed unit LHO03 and attempted to lock the RefCav. The cavity immediately locked and immediately begain large oscillations in the PZT. However unlike the last test after about 2 minutes or so the oscillations quit and the RefCav seemed mostly happy (we had to pause the FSS guardian so it would stop yanking the gains around and we set them at -10dB and waited). We did have one moment where the RefCav lost lock for no apparent reason and once it relocked it had the PZT oscillations again. This time they did not clear on their own so we unlocked the and relocked the cavity. The oscillations started again but this time they did clear after about 2 minutes with the gains at -10dB. Now with a seemingly happily locked RefCav we took a TF to set the UGF and measured the crossover. The 5th attachment shows the TF with a UGF of ~439kHz to get this we needed to raise the Common gain from 13dB to 22dB so this box apparently still has lower gain than SN LHO01. The 6th attachment shows the crossover measurement for setting the Fast gain this picture taken with a Fast gain of 10dB. We let it sit and watched for several minutes and the RefCav stayed locked and the loop didn't go into oscillation again. So it seems we have a mostly-working spare unit now with the caveat that the gains still aren't the same and the unit takes some time settle out once the RefCav is locked. The test mostly successful we removed unit LHO03 and went back to the EE shop. At this point Marc had finished characterizing unit LHO01 and indeed he found that the unit had more gain than LHO03. The PZT path was mostly the same with a couple dB more gain in unit LHO01 vs LHO03 but the EOM path at lower frequencies was roughly 20dB different (with unit LHO01 having more gain than LHO03). This fit with our observations from our locking test with unit LHO03. Since we wanted to test if unit LHO01 with the now-fixed PA85 would be better behaved we tuned the notches in the unit. The EOM notch was moved from ~1.77MHz to ~1.68MHz and we moved the PZT notch from ~36kHz (where we found it) to ~32.7kHz (to hopefully squash the new peak we see at ~32.7kHz). This done we took unit LHO01 out to the enclosure and reinstalled it with Fil once again helping out with the high voltage power supply. The RefCav locked almost immediately and had no PZT oscillations upon locking so we took a TF to set the UGF and measured the crossover. The 7th attachment shows the TF with a UGF of ~458kHz and a phase margin of 65.4°. The peak previously seen at ~1.68MHz is now completely gone so the EOM notch tuning was successful. There is still that feature around 750kHz but that has been there and not problematic since April 2015 when notches targeting it were removed. The peakiness previously seen around 500kHz seemed less than observed back on Nov 1st so we left the Common gain at 15dB (we can always lower it by a dB or two should we suspect the gain increase is causing instability with the knowledge this will lower the UGF significantly (2dB causes the UGF to be around 320kHz)). Looking at the crossover (final attachment) we decided to leave it at 5dB as the hump around 20kHz looked better here. It should be noted however that we did not see much change in the hump with small 1dB changes in the Fast gain we didn't start seeing a clear peak at the crossover until the Fast gain got to around 7dB+. It should also be noted that the peak at ~32.7kHz is still present. This indicates either our notch isn't deep enough to remove the peak or the peak is from something other than a PZT resonance. At this point I suspect it's something other than a PZT resonance as we see a 2nd and 3rd harmonic of this peak in the IN1 spectrum (2nd harmonic at ~65.5kHz 3rd at ~98kHz) I realized after we had left the LVEA that I didn't get a picture of the IN1 spectrum at the full span of the SR785 that shows these harmonics. This done we cleaned up and left the enclosure. Back in the Control Room we relocked the ISS and Tony relocked the IMC. There was some IMC instability seen but we chalked it up to ground motion from a recent earthquake. Marc mentioned that moving the PZT notch lowered the overall gain in the PZT path slightly so we raised the Fast gain to 6dB since we had seen a 1dB gain change not have a large effect on the crossover. Eventually once the environment had calmed down (Corey was on the Eve shift at this point) the relocking process began. The IMC lost lock during expected points in the initial alignment process so we weren't too worried about it. However there was one IMC lockloss during the relock (I think during Find IR?) and it took the IMC many minutes to relock. There were no PSL oscillations or glitches going on while we were waiting for the IMC to relock so not sure what the issue was it completely refused to grab lock and when it would look like it was going to grab it the IMC Trans image swung away quickly. Elenna did question why MC2 was apparently swinging around so much (the IMC Trans camera image was moving all over the place hinting at MC2 being pushed hard) so this behavior was not exactly normal. Eventually the IMC relocked and the locking process continued. At this point we called it a day hoping that things would be more stable overnight. Turns out they were not so we're still not sure where the problem is. Investigations will continue.

I'm writing an alog covering the entirety of our work yesterday right now but we raised the gains due to finding a bad component in the in-service TTFSS (the PA-85 high voltage op-amp in the EOM path) whose replacement removed reduced the observed zero crossings around 500kHz noted by Sheila et al here and corrected anomolies Marc observed in the EOM path TF (he has the data for this). We also correctly tuned the EOM notch to remove the 1.685MHz peak also seen in the linked alog. Raising the common gain put the FSS UGF back in its normal range (400kHz - 500kHz) and we raised the Fast gain by 1dB to compensate for a slight loss of gain in the PZT path caused by our moving the PZT notch from ~35.7kHz to ~32.7kHz. The TF and crossover measurement showed all should be well with the FSS after these fixes so it's still unclear why these IMC locklosses continue. Edit: Upon closer inspection of the TF the peakiness around 500kHz is still present but apparently less yet still close to a zero crossing. We could lower the Common gain by 1dB (to 14dB) to better clear the zero crossing if we suspect this is causing instability.,"{'term': 'LHO General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81244,jason.oberling@ligo.org

This new line does not show up in DARM but is sometimes large enough that it is getting impressed onto L1:GDS-CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN by the online NonSENS subtraction.As this is a narrow line at this time we've simply notched it out in the L1:OAF-IMC_WFS_B_I_PIT_PREFILT filter module using FM1 (called notch130).

From the guardian log (attached) it failed because AS_B_DC_NSUM was 20.3 when the shutter was closed and the threshold is 15. AS_B was 0.28. Fundamentally this is because I reduced the gain of this DC path by 20dB and digitally compensated in search for an existing sensor that won't rail when lock is lost and the same fast shutter test failure was observed (see alog 79104 ). Back then I wrote ""I adjusted the dark offset while IMC was unlocked but we can probably increase the threshold to 30 or so if it continues to bother us."" The dark offset has drifted enough to bother us at times (i.e. it is about 12 counts or so on average now) so I told Ibrahim to increase the thresholds only for AS_B i.e. PdBDarkLo=-40 # dark level low PdBDarkHi= 40 # dark level high in FAST_SHUTTER.py. Since we now have a dedicated diode to look at lock loss power spikes we can turn down the analog gain of AS_B_DC by 20dB and turn off +20dB filter in FM4 of H1:ASC-AS_B_DC_SEG[1234] filter and adjust the dark offset again on Tuesday.

Today this was mostly due to 3 reasons. 1. Environment: Wind gusts are currently 40 mph mostly above 30 mph for the whole day. There were a few gusts above 50 mph with a couple above 60mph (with one at 62 mph the highest I've seen). Secondary microseism is back over the 90% threshold for microseism. This is the main reason we were unable to lock during the shift. 2. IMC: The IMC glitch has dominated our locking attempts during lulls in the wind speed. It occured during initial alignment as well as during normal locking multiple times. This occured a few times after we had already locked DRMI under such windy conditions and so getting back to DRMI was either glitchy or windy and only happened twice today. The glitch has happened during all non-windy lock acquisitions. 3. Fast Shutter Error : At 20:01 we were at CHECK_AS_SHUTTERS during a lull in wind speed when we lost lock. After this locklossm the HAM6 SHUTTER status alert went red and guardian warned me not to power up. After calling a couple of people Keita was able to diagnose the issue as a code threshold error. I went into the fast shutter guardian and changed the threshold of PdBDarkLo from -15 to -40 and PdBDarkHi from 15 to 40. More background and info is available in Keita's comment to my midshift alog 81320 . This took 1hr 43 mins to diagnose and solve. A calibration sweep has not been done yet (since Saturday).

First we had planned comissioning from 8:30AM to 11:30AM during which comissioners continued investigating the IMC. Sheila went into the LVEA to realign onto the POP and ALS beatnotes following a PR3 move that got higher buildups which was successful. For this we stayed at CHECK_VIOLINS_BEFROE_POWERUP (losing lock twice from there due to IMC losing lock). We then got to locking and were able to acquire NLN and go into OBSERVING for 30 minutes (starting 21:44 UTC). The IMC glitch then caused a Lockloss (alog 81338) . After this LL we were unable to lock DRMI despite just having done an initial alignment. Tried touching up PRM and SRM during PRMI and DRMI respectively succeeding in the former and failing in the latter. I decided to do an initial alignment which happened fully automatically. We were able to lock DRMI but a lockloss at CARM_5_PICOMETERS brought us down due to the IMC glitch. We were then able to come back up to NLN fully automatically finally getting to OBSERVING. Overall high microseism and IMC glitches made locking difficult. We still got there in the end though.

This indeed got somewhat okay flashes on both ALSs so will be a fine place to start from once the reference cavity is locked again. However I found that TMSY's pitch slider has a minus sign with respect to the OSEM readbacks for pitch. This is the only slider (out of pit or yaw for all 6 optics that affect ALS alignment for either arm) that seems to have this issue. In the attached screenshot when I try to move the TMS up the OSEM readbacks say it went down and vice versa.

LLO has been using this for O4 and in terms of an automation step this would be comparable to our Increase_Flashes state. Increase_Flashes is very simple in how it works - move one direction one degree of freedom at a time look for better cavity flashes move the other way if they get worse. While this is reliable it is very slow since we have to wait for one period of the quad between each step (20seconds) to ensure we dont miss a flash. The last two days I spent some time converting Adam's state Scan_Alignment for use at LHO adjusting thresholds and other parameters and trying to improve on parts of it so it might work a bit more reliably. The most notable change I've made is to get data from the fast channel for the arm transmission rather than collecting slow channel data. This seemed to help a bit but this completely relies on nds calls that we've historically found not 100% reliable. I've also lowered minimum thresholds thanks to the previous change. This allows it to start off from basically no light in the cavity and bring it up to a decent alignment. After these changes it seems to really improve the flashes from a very misaligned starting point but I'm not sure it's any faster than the Increase_Flashes state. In the attached example it took around 20-30 min to go from little to no light to a decent amount. I'm testing this without the PLL and PDH locked so it's hard to say exactly how well aligned it is and how much better it can get. Next I'd like to take some time on a Tuesday to test with a PDH&PLL locked ALS and compare it to the time it takes compared to Increase_Flashes for a very misaligned cavity and a barely misaligned cavity. I've committed the changes I've made to ALS_ARM.py ALS_YARM.py (both in common) to the SVN. This created a new state - SCAN_ALIGNMENT - that I'll keep there but isn't in the state graph so it cannot be reached.

I'm looking at times when the interferometer is in the low noise state (for H1 ISC_LOCK >=600 for L1 ISC_LOCK >=2000). The first piechart shows what guardian states we spend the most time in this is pretty similar to what Mattia reported in 79623 The histograms of lock segement lengths and relocking times show that L1's lock stretches are longer than H1s and that we've had 34 individual instances where we were down for longer than 12 hours. (And that H1 has a lot of short locks) The rolling and cumulative avergage plot shows how the drop in duty cycle in O4b compare to O4a is due to individual problems including the OFI break pressure spikes and laser issues. Lastly the final plot shows how we accumulate uptime and down time bined by length of the segments. This shows that L1 accumulates more uptime than Hanford by having more locks in the 30-50 hour range. The downtime accumulation shows that just under half of our downtime is from times when we were down for more than 16 hours (serious problems) and about 1/4 of it is due to routine relocking that takes less than 2.5 hours. The script and data used to make these plots can be found in DutyCycleO4a.py and H1(L1)ISCLockState_04.txt in this git repo .

Oberling R. Short Since we've convinced ourselves that the new glitching is coming from the recently-installed NPRO SN 1661 we are swapping it out for our final spare SN 1639F. This is the NPRO originally installed with the aLIGO PSL back in the 2011/2012 timeframe it was removed from operation in late 2017 (natural degradation of pump diodes) and sent back to Coherent for refurbishment and has not been used outside of brief periods in the OSB Optics Lab since. We first installed the power supply for this NPRO and tweaked the potentiometers on the remote board to make sure our readbacks in the PSL Beckhoff software were correct. We then swapped the NPRO laser head on the PSL table and got the new one in position. The injection current was set for ~1.8W of output power we need 1.945A for ~1.805 W output from the NPRO. We test the remote ON/OFF which worked and the remote noise eater ON/OFF which also worked. We optimized the polarization cleanup optics (a QWP/HWP/PBSC triple combo for turning the NPRO's naturally slightly elliptically polarized beam into vertically polarized w.r.t. the PSL tabletop). The power was turned down and the beam was roughly aligned using our alignment irises (with the mode matching lenses removed). At this point we did a beam propagation measurement and Gaussian fit in prep for mode matching to Amp1. The results: Horizontal Waist: 176.0 µm Position: -124.3 mm Vertical Waist: 182.0 µm Position: -169.3 mm Average Waist: 178.8 µm Position: -147.2 mm Using this we got a preliminary mode matching solution in JamMT using the same lenses we used for NPRO SN 1661 so we installed it. I managed to get a picture before JamMT crashed on us see first attachment. Before tweaking mode matching we checked our polarization into Faraday isolator FI01. We have ~1.602 W in transmission of FI01 with ~1.701 W input a throughput of ~94.2%. We then proceeded with optimizing the mode matching solution. It took several iterations (7 to be exact) but we finally were able to get the beam waist and position correct for Amp1 (the target is a 165 µm waist 60mm in front of Amp1 or 1794.2mm from the NPRO): Horizontal: Waist: 166.0 µm Position: 1789.0 mm Vertical Waist: 163.0 µm Position: 1800.0 mm Average Waist: 164.6 µm Positoin: 1794.5 mm To finish we set up a temporary PBSC to check that the polarization going into Amp1 was vertical w.r.t. the PSL tabletop. We put a power meter in transmission of the temporary PBSC and adjust WP02 to minimize the transmitted power the lowest we could get is 0.41 mW (with a roughly 1.6 W beam) in the wrong polarization which matches what we had during the most recent NPRO swap so we were good to go here. We forgot to measure the final lens positions before leaving the enclosure we will do that first thing tomorrow morning. The new NPRO is now set aligned and mode matched to Amp1 and we will continue with amplifier recovery tomorrow. We left the NPRO running overnight with enclosure in Science mode the first shutter (between the NPRO and Amp1) is closed. ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81409,jason.oberling@ligo.org

It is saved in sheila.dwyer/PSL/modematching along with a copy of the a la mode code (alm). I took the beam profile measurements that they saved in /ligo/gitcommon/labutils/beam_scans/Data/NPRO_a_21Nov2024.txt and used them for fitting. In this text file the distances are a rail location I used the information in 80895 and compared it to what I got by fitting the data in NPRO_26Oct2024.txt to find the offset between their rail distances and their coordinate system. From their data I get a horizontal waist at 162.1um at -0.097 meters and a vertical waist of 182.1 um at -0.176 meters (see first attachment). This is more astigmatism than the laser 1661 had. If no mode matching had been done at all with this NPRO swap we would end up with an overlap of 87% to amp1 (sqrt(X overlap* y overlap)). I used the average of the vertical and horizontal waist locations and asked a la mode to optimize lens 2 + 3 for that average waist (as Jason and Ryan were only planning to move lens 2 + 3 to avoid changing the waist through the EOM).

Then I just made some simple time series comparison plots between several PSL channels and PSL PEM channels. In particular the PSL channels I used were: H1:PSL-FSS_FAST_MON_OUT_DQ H1:PSL-FSS_TPD_DC_OUT_DQ H1:IMC-MC2_TRANS_SUM_IN1_DQ H1:PSL-PWR_NPRO_OUT_DQ H1:PSL-PMC_MIXER_OUT_DQ H1:PSL-PMC_HV_MON_OUT_DQ. I compared those to the following PSL PEM channels: H1:PEM-CS_ACC_PSL_PERISCOPE_X_DQ H1:PEM-CS_ACC_PSL_PERISCOPE_Y_DQ H1:PEM-CS_ACC_PSL_TABLE1_X_DQ H1:PEM-CS_ACC_PSL_TABLE1_Y_DQ H1:PEM-CS_ACC_PSL_TABLE1_Z_DQ H1:PEM-CS_ACC_PSL_TABLE2_Z_DQ H1:PEM-CS_MIC_PSL_CENTER_DQ. For this analysis I've only looked at 3 time periods but will do more. Below are some things I've seen so far: I definitely do see correlations between the IMC/FSS (IMC_MC2_TRANS & FSS_FAST_MON) channels and the PEM PSL sensors. In particular it seems like the most consistent correlations are with the PSL_PERISCOPE_X/Y and PSL_TABLE1_X/Y/Z channels. In some cases there was a visible glitch in PSL_TABLE2_Z but the amplitude is much less than in the other PEM channels. Some PEM glitches correlate with the glitching in PMC_HV_MON but this was only the case for 2 of the 3 times I looked at. Some PEM glitches correlate with PMC_MIXER but I wonder if that is just a coincidence (see slide 9 for an example) I have seen no obvious correlation with the PEM PSL sensor glitches and the NPRO_PWR channel. From my very limited dataset so far it seems like the most interesting area is where the PSL_PERISCOPE_X/Y and PSL_TABLE1_X/Y/Z channels are located.

17497,H1 General - Possibility of microseismic ground motion induced scattering at LHO,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81400,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 13:22:53 -0800",[Debasmita Anamaria] We wanted to check if there is any microseismic coupling at LHO similar to that of LLO. So far for LLO our understanding is that the microseismic ground motion (0.1-0.5 Hz) is being amplified by a potential scatterer which has a transfer function as shown in the first image . This transfer function was modeled based on some other information and seems to explain the LLO noise quiet well ( LLO aLOG 73845 ). For LHO we amplified the ground motion by the same transfer function and simulated the scatter shelf. If we assume that the scattered light amplitude is same as LLO (4e-10) given the amount of microseismic ground motion at LHO the scatter shelf falls below the current DARM spectra of LHO ( second image ). Even if we double the light amplitude the scatter shelf does not show up above the present noise background ( third image ) but it comes quiet close to the noise floor. But if we double the microseismic ground motion and then further amplify it by the model transfer function the scatter shelf shows up above the present DARM spectra ( fourth image ). This shows that the same source which is producing the microseismic scattering at LLO can produce similar noise at LHO but it will only be visible if the IFO is locked during a somewhat high microseismic motion. Even if the amount of light is half of what it is at LLO the scatter shelf would still be visible if the ground motion is higher ( fifth image ). I used the ground motion as it was during 2023-12-06 11:00:00 UTC at LHO. This is one of the high microseismic days of LHO the median of rms ground motion in 0.1-0.3 Hz was 689.66 nm/s and in 0.3-1.0 Hz was 95.02 nm/s. In the last image I plot all the simulated traces together for a better visualization of how the light amplitude and amount of motion can modify the scatter shelf.

What can cause PMC mixer glitches? NPRO Laser frequency glitches .... seems likely PMC cavity length glitches (e.g. servo electronics or PZT) .... most likely no 81390 . Likely PDH is optically sensing real glitches as we have already switched the 35.5 MHz LO to the Marconi 81277 that made no difference ...... rule out the 35.5 MHz LO. Unlikely PMC because the PMC mixer glitches on the scope seem too fast for the PMC locking electronics. Daniel found that the ""PMC servo drives the PZT with a 3.3K series resistor forming a ~1kHz low pass with the PZT capacitance of ~45nF. This yields a chracteristic time constant of ~150us. The glitches as seen by the PMC mixer are at least a few times faster than this."" 81390 Daniel's scope photo here shows ""a train of PMC mixer glitches going as high as ~70mVpk (or ~70kHz)"" similar to the zoomed-in glitches Peter showed above. So this means that glitches originating in the PMC locking servo or PZT electronics would change the PMC cavity length too slowly to create the fast PMC mixer glitches we observe. Seems unlikely that PMC servo locking electronics are the issue. Unlikely mechanical / PZT issues given the very nice PMC cavity scans - optically the cavity scans don't show glitches or issues as a function of the PZT drive ( remote scope traces + sheila pmc pzt scan photo ). Biggest change to the glitches came from swapping the original O4 laser to now the O3 laser. Glitches changed when lasers changed: see Camilla lho:81386 . Seems like a clue that the glitches are related to the specific lasers themselves. Talking with Jason and RyanS some summary of the NPROs available: (S/N 1661) The O3 NPRO was swapped in recently. Potentially we now see the same problems with 1661 was seen in the end of O3b. Camilla's 81386 shows that the FSS oscillations with this laser in O4 look a lot like its issues at the end of O3b. In 2020 these FSS issues originally prompted Camilla to create the FSS_OSCILLATION tags. These FSS_OSCILLATION tags started to be flagged regularly again in mid-Sept 2024 but with the original O4 laser the FSS oscillations looked totally different: see her log 81386. (S/N 7974) The original O4 NPRO was in use Sept 2017 - June 2018 when it was uninstalled ( 42652 ) seemingly due to similar fast FSS glitches leading to a broken noise eater. Jason looked at alogs from time of removing this NPRO in 2018 and the 2018 glitches look like the original Sept 2024 glitches. 7974 was then sent back to Coherent for repair + refurbished. This is the newest NPRO bought in 2015 and the only one that Coherent will service. Then 7974 was installed for O4. (S/N 1639F) The ""third"" NPRO is from O1 and was in use for many years 2011-2017. It was wearing out its lifetime and running out of power then removed and refurbished. Since was only used a few times in the optics lab. Will try this 3rd NRPO.

There is large individual glitches seen by both FSS and the NPRO PWR in an otherwise quiet signal before the NPRO swap. Plotted after the NPRO swap here and zoomed here. There is none of these individual glitches after the swap but there is the slower building oscillation in the FSS channel which is overall noisier. The FSS oscillations we are seeing now are similar to the FSS_OSCLATION locklosses we saw at the end of O3b ( G2201762: O3a_O3b_summary.pdf ). Note that the current NPRO is the same NPRO as we used in O3. Is it possible that we fixed the glitches issues but reinstalled a laser with similar issues as we saw in O3b? We could revisit that time period to see if we had similar IMC locking issues then too.

Peter's alog comment last night ( 81375 ) leads us to understand the glitches are around 2 kHz in frequency so above the PMC bandwidth. Therefore we want to calibrate the PMC error signal. Luckily for us Jeff Kissel recently did some PMC scans to determine the PMC PZT Hz/V calibration for a different purpose alog 73905 (thanks Jeff!). We used his DTTs to determine the time it took to scan one FSR see screenshot . We determined that it took 0.52 seconds to scan one FSR and the scan rate is approximately 6.75 V/s (we know the PZT is nonlinear but we figure this estimate is good enough for our purposes). This gives us 3.51 V/FSR on the PZT or 0.0236 V/MHz using the FSR = 148.532 MHz from T0900616 . We are still thinking about how to calibrate the PMC mixer signal.

(presumably good) laser + PMC bad = same PMC mixer glitches 81371 1) Are these +/-0.1 V PMC mixer glitches the problem? Yes probably. 2) Are these big PMC mixer glitches caused or worsened by the FSS? No. PMC mixer glitches basically same with FSS on 81356 and off 81371 . 3) Are the laser + PMC mixer glitches new? Yes probably. If these PMC glitches always there could it be that we were previously able to ride them out before and not now? But this would imply that in addition to the new glitches the FSS secondarily degraded. Seems very unlikely: already several problems (bad amp new eom needed new notch etc) have been fixed with FSS and the FSS OLTFs and in-loop spectra look good.

The period of large glitches started around 2 am (7:37 UTC on Nov 20th) and ended when a power glitch turned off the laser at 7 am (15 UTC) 81376 . Some of the small glitches in that time frame time seem to be at the same time that the reference cavity was resonanting (with low transmission) but many of the large glitches do not line up with times when the reference cavity was resonanting. I've zoomed in on most of the times when the PMC mixer glitches reached 0.1 and see that there are usually small jumps in NPRO power at the time of these glitches although the times don't always line up well and the small power glitches are happening very often so this might be a coincidence. ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81379,sheila.dwyer@ligo.org

We started from the PEM rack in the CER plugging the HS1 through the SR560 into the L4C interface chassis confirming the HS1 would see something when we tapped it. We then moved out to the PEM bulkhead by HAM4 again confirmed the HS1/SR560 combo still showed signal when tapping the HS1. Then we moved to the biergaren and plugged in the HS1/SR560 right next to the other seismometers. While watching the readout in the DAQ of the HS1 and one of the Guralps I have connected to the PEM AA we could see that both sensors could see when I slapped the ground near the seismometers but the signal was barely above what looks like electronics noise on the HS1 while the Guralp showed lots of signal that looked like ground motion. We tried gains from 50-200 on the SR560 none of them really seemed to improve the snr of the HS1. The HS1 is still plugged in over night but I don't think this particular sensor is going to measure much ground motion.

TJ Recently the CO2Y laser that we replaced on Oct 22 has been struggling to stay locked for long periods of time ( alog81271 and trend from today ). We've found some loose or bad cables in the past that have caused us issues so we went out on table today to double check they are all ok. The RF cables that lead into the side of the laser can slightly impact the output power when wiggled in particular the ones with a BNC connector but not to the point that we think it would be causing issues. The only cable that we found loose was for the PZT that goes to the head of the laser. The male portion of the SMA that comes out of the laser head was loose and cannot be tightened from outside of the laser. We verified that the connection from this to the cable were good but wiggling it did still introduce glitched in the PZT channel. I don't think that we've conviced ourselves that this is a problem though because the PZT doesn't seem to glitch when the laser loses lock and instead it will run away. An unfortunate consequence of the cable wiggling was that one of the Beckhoff plugs at the feedthrough must have been unseated slightly and caused our mask flipper read backs to read incorrectly. The screws for this plug were not working so we just pushed the plug back in to fully seat it and all seemed to work again. We still are not sure why we've been having these lock losses lately the 2nd and 3rd attachments show a few of them from the last day or so. They remind me of back in 2019 when we saw this - example1 example2 . The fix ultimately a chiller swap ( alog54980 ) but the flow and water temp seem more stable this time around.

In the attached screenshot you can see that there are a few large disturbances during this time which show up with an amplitude of 0.1 on the PMC mixer channel and large oscillations in the FSS fast monitor (30 counts) dips in the reference cavity transmission and glitches in the PMC high voltage. The second screenshot shows a zoomed in version of the problem times. We also noticed that unplugging the feedback from the IMC to the VCO changed the reference cavity transmitted power by about 1% Daniel suggests that this might be OK because the change in laser frequency causes a small change in alignment out of the AOM. We set the FSS autolocker to off at 19:54 UTC. This doesn't acutaly disable the FSS but we can track times when the reference cavity would go through resonance by watching in the trans PD.

Since this is not necessary any more (see plots in alog 81130 ) and since keeping this means that we have to either adjust dark offset once in a while and/or making the ""shutter closed"" threshold for Fast Shutter test ( alog 81320 ) I set the gain switch back to ""HIGH"" and disabled the +20dB digital gain in H1:ASC-AS_B_DC_SEG[1234] FM4.

We have found a BBSS configuration that doesn't drift after some extended settling time. However the BBSS configuration that doesn't drift has extreme blade positions so we hope to change d0 and d1 parameters to get a more ""healthy"" BBSS. We have been fighting a pitch drift in the BBSS for some time. Here is what we know: The pitch drift is not a thermal effect and is seen always in one direction. The daily drift due to temperature can sometimes be seen on top of the pitch drift but the drift dominates. The drift is usually pretty linear over long periods of time. The drift is primarily in the top mass. M2 and M3 stages see far less of the drift but do move slowly as the top mass moves. Since the drift is dominated by M1 we have tried a lot of different configurations. Initially we thought the blades that hold the wire leading from M1 to M2 was to high (this is related to the d1 parameter of a suspension). So we lowered the blades and tried a couple different configurations. Then it was discovered that the issue was not from the blades on M1 but rather the point where M1 is supported. The ""pickup"" point of M1 was below the center of mass while nominally it should be above (this is the d0 parameter of a suspension). To remedy this we lowered the center of mass on M1 and lowered the blades on M1 to ensure that the pickup point of m1 is above the center of mass and the blade tips leading to M2 are below the center of mass. Initially we were worried that the suspension was still drifting but after a few days and relieving some rubbing the pitch drift was gone. Currently we lowered the center of mass further to see if our theory on why the pitch drift stopped is correct but the suspension hasn't had enough time to settle yet. The blades are currently quite low (-6 mm below there nominal values). At some point we hope to raise them to a more reasonable height off nominal. To help raise the blades and buy both us an Hanford some margin of stability Betsy is getting some parts fabricated to raise the d0 value of the suspension. Attached is a long drift log with a short description of the many configurations and plots of their pitch. F1 + F2 + F3 are the three bosems that contribute to pitch.

Additionally I noticed the DC power suppy for the RGA is resting against the stand. I went ahead and put a few viton pads under the RGA's DC power suppy in case it was making noise as current goes up (e.g. filament on vs off in alog 74095 ). RGA is plugged in and ON now at the X-Mid. 4:19 PM - Turned RGA fillaments ON for X-Mid Y-Mid LVEA-X Beamtube LVEA-Y Beamtube. Will submit a new work permit to take scans at 4 weeks after resuming interferometer operation next maintence Tuesday. I plan on taking the last set of scans Tuesday morning then unplugging every RGA on site before maintenance period is over so everything is off over Thanksgiving. If the noise at the X-Mid station from the RGA should be shifted now from alog 74088 since we changed the mechanical dampening characteristics of the support stand. Closing WP 11940 .

As a result the measurements may vary and could be off by a few millimeters. This time with the assistance of two colleagues from Spain I was able to improve the accuracy of the measurements. We measured from the outer edge of the top of the ALS table instead of from the inside. Additionally we confirmed that the viewport diameter is approximately 10 inches as indicated in D1200873 . Furthermore we check the position of the green beam on the viewport. The beam is located as follows: Vertical position Horizontal Location of ALS beam on the viewport (BSC5 - VP C90G3) ~ 5 3/4"" from the outer top edge of the Viewport guard ~4 1/4"" from the left outer edge of the Viewport guard 14.6 cm 10.795 cm See the pictures attached for reference.

Looking at the BLRMs we decided that 5.6/-1.1 was better than 5.6/-0.85 so left it there . Sdfs accepted attached. We had to pause SQZ_MANAGER as it was not letting us bring SQZ_ANG_ADJUST to DOWN. Also worked by taking SQZ_MANAGER to SCAN_SQZ_ANG. Future improvements: Repeat now we have the ASC on. Can we do this in anti-squeezing to be faster (hard to use ASC). Do we need to have the servo turn off SQZ_ANG_ADJUST and scan SQZ ang at each step or can we just leave the servo running? We also turned the FC beam-spot control on to test it again while we are thermalizing (worked fine) and turned it off before finishing commissioning: reverted sdfs so H1:SQZ-FC_ASC_INJ_ANG_{PY}_OUTPUT are frozen a edited sqzparams and reloaded.

The autolocker fails to lock so the TPD drops back to zero and the temperature search continues. The pattern seen in the PMC_HV signal is the PMC following the NPRO frequency change as the FSS autolocker slowly ramps the NPRO crystal temperature to try to lock the RefCav (this is why the NPRO temperature channel has the same shape as PMC_HV). Not clear why the RefCav doesn't want to lock as quickly with this NPRO as it did with the previous ones but we did see this behavior upon FSS recovery last Friday (I had to lock the RefCav manually so we could move on with PSL recovery as the autolocker was taking too long). I recall seeing this behavior in the past (pre-COVID) and at the time we couldn't figure out the cause. Will look into this more after the Thanksgiving holiday.

I also wanted to compare it to our current Increase_Flashes state both in duration and execution. The big changed from last week's testing is that now that we have a working PSL the PLL and PDH loops are locked. This seemed to really help out and it seems like a very viable solution for a faster alignment state.

I haven't put the functionality back into Scan_Alignment to hold and alignment if it get above threshold so once I can test that out again it will speed up the smaller misalignment scans. Saving a few minutes for every acquisition that needs some alignment work should add up pretty quick. If given more time next week I'd like to test this some more with that functionality and see how much faster it is. I'd love to get this into production soon but I really want to thoroughly test this. Last week Jenne had to comment out an import of aslArmconfig out of ALS_ARM.py in order for ALS_XARM to run ( alog81424 ). This was a bit odd to me since this file contained info for both arms and should be fine. I ended up restarting ALS_XARM and this worked. Seems like another case of issue 22 .

The following solution while not perfect is just good enough to get us to next Tuesday maintenance. 1 - Failed supply fan on CER-C5 LHS ISC-R2&R4 +24V is runnning at 90F front and rear no airflow. The ambient air in that location is very cool and the current draw is quite low so we do not expect this supply to trip in these conditions. Fernando noticed that the -24V supply on the same rack is also slightly elevated in temperature and does not have good air flow so we suspect this supply fan is comprimised as well. Neither of these supplies have had their fans upgraded yet. 2 - Failed supply fan on EX-VDD-1 ISC-R1 +24V 3A was running at 110F front and rear no airflow. This supply has not had its fan upgraded yet. The PCAL team was using this supply so we could not replace it before close of maintenance window. We applied supplementary cooling to the power supply to see it through until next Tuesday. After supplemental cooling we measured 85F front and 95F rear. The power supply tray had to be pulled out about 1 foot into the walkway to make space for the supplemental cooling I placed cones around the hazard be mindful of the extended rack tray if you do go out to EX berfore next Tuesday.

We suspect this to be due to slightly worse mode-matching into the PMC which we plan to check in the coming weeks. ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81485,ryan.short@ligo.org

TJ and I are investigating. So far we know that SRM sees elevated noise while in PREP_FOR_SRY particularly after SRM re-alignment. We've also found that AS_C SUM is too low to be considered locked at this state but that ALIGN_IFO guardian continues with SR initial alignment leading to the WD trip. The current hypothesis is that SRM is catching onto a wrong mode but tricking the automation into continuing alignment. The first screenshot shows the incidence of the WD tripping during initial alignment happening frequently after 10/30. There is one instance of it happening 10/16 but nothing in the near past before that. The second shows one recent instance of this trip leading to the WD trip.

The IFO range has been mostly below 160Mpc with short times near 165Mpc in the first hour of each lock. The first attachment shows a comparison of the cleaned GDS strain sensitivity at the 165 Mpc time to later in the lock along with coherences from the lower range time. The sensitivity earlier in the lock was broadly better from 18-55 Hz there are coherences with both ASC and LSC that are contributing to the noise from 18-27 Hz so we spent some time trying to address those. The worse sensitivty from 27-55 Hz is not explained by these coherences and the usual squeezing adjustments ( 81463 81458 ) don't seem to be able to help. We might think about checking both the SRC detuning and the filter cavity detuning to see if they make an impact in this region. We do seem to have slightly less high frequency squeezing than in the past. To address the ASC coherences I ran the A2L script that TJ put in userapps/isc/h1/scripts/a2l/a2l_min_multi.py with the command python a2l_min_multi.py --all The second attachment shows this script running using an ndscope template that is in sheila.dwyer/ndscope/ASC/A2L_script_ADS.yaml The first time through the pitch a2l gains for ETMY ITMY and ITMX were all set to the maximum that the script checks so we ran it again. The third attachment shows the coherences (with no squeezing) after this A2L adjustment and Camilla's adjustment of the PRCL feedforward . In the past we've seen that after running this a2l script we can do slightly better by dong a manual adjustment based on injections into CHARD or DHARD ( 79921 80250 ) we haven't taken the time to check that today but the script does seem to have helped in the frequency region where it's measuring. It has made the CHARD Y coherence worse below 15 Hz which we've seen consistently when the decoupling is good around 20-30 Hz. The last attachment shows a comparison of the DARM sensitivty in the high range early part of the lock the lower later sensitivity and currently after these retunings but without squeezing. This suggests that our adjustments did a good job below 27 Hz where we the squeezing does have an impact in this frequency band where we haven't yet recovered the sensitivity.

The new positions: L02: 1251.5 mm L21: 1137.5 mm Amplifier Recovery With the previous day's work resulting in the NPRO being ready for amplifier recovery this is where we started our recovery work. Amplifier recovery was straightfoward. As a reminder we first measure the power into the amp and the unpumped power out to assess our intial alignment. Then we raise the amp pump diode operating current in 1A intervals until we get to the locking point adjusting beam alignment into the amplifier at each step in current (so alignment follows the formation of the thermal lenses in the amplifier crystals). For Amp1 we had 1.612 W input and an unpumped output of 1.252 W. This is 77.6% throughput which is above our requirement of 65% throughput before starting to pump the amplifier so we proceeded with recovery of Amp1 (see Amp1 columns in below table). We finished Amp1 recovery with ~70.2 W output so we calibrated the Amp1 power monitor PD to this value (was off by a couple Watts). We then lowered the light level in the Amp1/Amp2 path (using the High Power Attenuator (HPA) after Amp1) and checked alignment all looked good. We increased the Amp2 seed with the HPA to ~1.8 W and checked the unpumped output from Amp2. This measured at ~1.5 W which is ~83% throughput and above our 65% threshold so we proceeded with recovery of Amp2. This also went very well see the Amp2 column in the below table we had ~64.0 W output from Amp2 with an ~1.8 W initial seed power (the power was bouncing between 63.9 W and 64.0 W). With Amp2 fully powered we then used the HPA to increase the Amp2 seed to max which resulted in ~ 140.2 W output from Amp2. Current (A) Amp1 Output Power (W) Amp2 Output Power (W) Initial P out Final P out Initial P out Final P out 1 1.25 1.25 1.6 1.6 2 1.46 2.37 3.0 3.0 3 6.11 8.43 9.1 9.3 4 16.6 18.1 18.2 18.4 5 28.6 28.6 28.1 28.4 6 39.6 39.6 38.0 38.2 7 50.3 50.4 47.4 47.5 8 60.7 60.7 55.8 56.8 9 70.2 70.2 63.7 64.0 Stabilization System Recovery PMC: After lunch we began recovering the PSL stabilization systems in order: PMC ISS FSS. We began by using the HPA after Amp2 to lower the power to ~100 mW to check our beam alignment up to the PMC. All looked good here so we increased the power to max and measured the power incident on the PMC at ~129.4 W. We then toggled the PMC autolock to ON and it locked without issue. We needed to use the picomotor-equipped mirrors (M11 and M12 on the layout) to tweak the beam alignment into the PMC but were only able to get ~102.0 W in transmission with ~27.0 W in reflection. This is 9 W more than we had after our last NPRO swap indicating that we really need to take a look at PMC mode matching since we still had more than enough power to deliver to the IFO we decided to defer the mode matching work to a later Tuesday and continue with PSL recovery. The PMC Trans and Refl monitor PDs were calibrated to the newly measured values they were pretty close to begin with but were still 1-2 W different than our power meter was measuring. We then returned the amplifer pump diode currents to their previous operating values (9.0 A and 8.8 A for Amp1 9.1 A and 9.1 A for Amp2) which lowered Amp1 output power from ~70 W to ~68 W and Amp2 output power from ~140 W to ~139 W this also changed PMC Refl to ~24 W and PMC Trans to ~104 W indicating our beam is better matched to our current mode matching solution at these pump diode currents. ISS: Moving on to the ISS we first measured the amount of power in our 1st order diffracted beam (the ""power bank"" for the ISS). With the loop off and the AOM diffracting a default of 4% we expect ~5.7 W in this beam and this is what we measured. AOM alignment was good so moved on to the ISS PDs in the ISS box. A voltmeter get plugged into the DC Out ports on the ISS box and a HWP inside the box is adjusted until PD voltages read ~10.0 V. We did this but noticed the DC voltage reading on the ISS MEDM screen was much higher ~12.5 V for PDA and ~13 V for PDB. We tried to lock the loop and as expected with PD voltages that high the loop thought it needed to removed more power from the beam and ran the diffracted power up really high. We immediately unlocked the ISS and began looking into what could be the problem as the MEDM reading on the ISS PDs generally matches the voltmeter reading (I say ""generally matches"" because for reasons unknown to me the ISS does not use the DC out from its PDs it uses a Filter out and ""derives"" the DC and AC PD voltages from that). The PDs appeared to be working correctly and we found no large dark voltages that would indicate a PD failure/malfunction. When we unplugged the Filter output the PD reading in MEDM began to slowly climb but when we blocked the light onto the PDs the MEDM reading went to zero. Looking back at trends we saw the PDs behaving as expected before this most recent NPRO swap only reading these higher values in MEDM with the relock of the PMC an hour or so prior. I had never seen this behavior in the past so wasn't quite sure where the problem could be. Thinking maybe something had gone wrong in either the ISS inner loop servo box or maybe something in the CER we called Fil and asked if he could take a look at the CER electronics for the ISS while we moved on to FSS recovery. It was at this point we found the problem. When the FSS MEDM screen was opened the first thing we saw was one NPRO noise eater (NE) light green and the other red. The green light was our NE enable monitor indicating that the NE toggle was switched ON in the PSL software the red light was our NE monitor which reads the Check output from our NPRO monitor PD that indicates whether or not the NPRO's relaxation oscillation was being supressed. So we had the NE toggled ON but it was clearly not working so we toggled it off and on again. The NE monitor went green and the channel monitoring the relaxation oscillation indicated it was working properly and the ISS PD values on the ISS MEDM screen now read the correct values. So I learned that we have another measure of if the NE is working or not the ISS PD readings on the MEDM screen go higher. Trending back the NE stopped working at ~16:58 PST on Thursday right before Ryan and I left the enclosure for the day. We'll keep an eye on this as right now it's not clear why the NE turned off. At this point everything looked good for the ISS so we moved on to the FSS. FSS: For the FSS we first tried to see if the RefCav would lock with the autolocker it would not. We had to manually tune the NPRO temperature to find a RefCav resonance one was found with a slider value of ~ +0.06. The temperature search ranges were adjsuted to this new value and we tried the autolocker again. While we could see clear flashes the autolocker would not grab lock for some reason. The FSS guardian was paused so it would stop yanking the gains around upon lock acquisition but this did not help the autolocker refused to hold lock for some reason. So I did it manually (from the FSS manual screen manually change NPRO temperature until a resonance flashed through then really quickly move the mouse up to turn the loop on if the loop grabs go back to the FSS MEDM screen and turn on the Temperature loop if not then turn the loop off and try again) which worked. With a locked RefCav we measured a RefCav TPD voltage of ~ 0.84 V. The RefCav Refl spot looked pretty centered so we did not do any alignment tuning. This completed our work in the enclosure so we cleaned up turned the computers and monitors off left the enclosure and put it into Science mode. Outside we scaned the NPRO for mode hop regions and measured TFs of the stabilization loops. NPRO Temperature Scan Now outside the enclosure we set up to scan the NPRO temperatures to check for mode hopping. We took the HV Monitor output from the PMC fieldbox to trigger an oscillscope on the PZT ramp and used the PMC Trans PD to monitor the peaks. We set the PMC's alignment ramp to +/- 7.0 V and a 1 Hz scan rate and monitored the peaks as we tuned the NPRO crystal temperature. We used the slider on the FSS Manual MEDM screen which gives us a total range of approximately +/- 0.8 °C (0.01 on the slider changes the NPRO crystal temperature by roughly 0.01 °C and the slider goes from -0.8 to +0.8). Since we were close to zero on slider sitting at ~ +0.07 we started by moving lower (which reduces the NPRO crystal temperature) our starting crystal temperature as read at the NPRO power supply front panel was 24.22 °C. We got all the way to the negative end of the slider which gave a crystal temperature of 23.38 °C and did not see any evidence of mode hopping on the way down. Heading back up we finally started to see early evidence of mode hopping near the top end of the slider we could clearly see a new forest of peaks show up in the PMC PZT scan and one of them started to grow noticebly as the temperature was further increased. This mode hop region began at a crystal temperature of 24.76 °C and the slider maxed out at 24.91 °C. At this point we still had not fully transitioned through the mode hop region but we did have a peak starting to grow very large indicating that we were almost there. Since we saw no evidence of mode hopping by making the temperature colder we went back to our starting place of 24.22 °C and then reduced the temperature further to the next RefCav resonance below that this resulted in a crystal temperature of 23.96 °C at a slider value around -0.17. Again I had to lock the RefCav manually as the autolocker did not want to grab and hold lock. With all of the stabilization systems locked we moved on to TF measurements. Transfer Functions and Gains We started with the PMC. With the current settings we have a UGF of ~1.6 kHz and 60° of phase margin see first attachment. Everything looked good so we left the PMC alone. For the ISS we have a UGF of ~45 kHz and a phase margin of 37.5° see second attachment. Again everything look normal here so we left the ISS alone. For the FSS we started with a Common gain of 15 dB. Everything looked OK but since we had seen some potential zero crossings that like to hide in the longer range scans we did a ""zoomed in"" scan from 100 kHz to 1 MHz. Sure enough there were a couple peaks in the 500 kHz to 600 kHz range that were pretty close to a zero crossing. We lowered the Common gain to 14 dB to move them away from the potential crossing the third attachment shows this zoomed in area with the Common gain at 14 dB and the peaks in question are clearly visible. With this Common gain we have a UGF of ~378 kHz with ~60° of phase margin see fourth attachment we took this TF out to 10MHz to check for any weirdness at higher frequency and did not see anything immediately concerning. To finish we took a look at the PZT/EOM crossover (around 20 kHz) to set the Fast gain. The final attachment shows this measurement (a spectrum of IN1) at a Fast gain of 5 dB this looks OK so we left the Fast gain as is. At this point the NPRO swap was complete the PSL was fully recovered and we handed things over to the commissioning team for IFO recovery. We still need to look at PMC mode matching and will do so during future Tuesday maintenance periods. This closes WP 12210 .

Extremely quiet shift. Intentionally dropped out of OBSERVING twice: To let Vicky tune SQZ while L1 was down. Sadly this did not seem to improve range. We were COMISSIONING between 04:19 UTC and 04:31 UTC (12 mins) To damp EY Mode 1. Vicky noticed DCPDs were growing and asked if Violins were high. Upon trending (screenshot) it seemed that EY Mode 1 had been increasing for the whole lock. I had to go to DAMP_VIOLINS_SIMPLE which took us out of OBSERVING between 04:53 UTC and 05:12 UTC (19 mins). Applying the nominal gain of 0.1 did not work so I played around with the gain increasing it by a further 0.1 and decreasing by 0.05 both in the negative and positive. While there were some short term successes overall my attempt did not help with counts always seeming worse than with nominal guardian damping (which is 0 gain). Not wanting to spend too much time out of OBSERVING I re-set the gain to 0 and gave guardian the reigns again. They're ever so slowly going down. My guess is that these violins are being rung up by the increasing secondary microseism which started noticeably increasing around 8 hours ago. It is about to cross the 0.9 threshold line. The primary microseism is also elevated as of 13 hrs ago. EY Mode 15 is also elevated but judging from the 1000(ish) hz lines on DARM and the value on the cts it is by a negligible amount (still below 10E-17 ASD) so I did not attempt to damp this. For our recent locks it seems as though the damping works up to 1-2 hrs into locking but then Mode 1 turns around and starts increasing in counts. I believe some more investigation into this is needed to perhaps find a better angle/gain to damp. (screenshot 2).

Saturday Calibration was run (coordinated with LLO). Overall locking was fairly easy although the ALS took a bit of time (not bad) and DRMI locking was a little tough and needed PRMI/CHECK_MICH_FRINGES. But after that locking has been automated. LOG: 1633 Lockloss (after 5hr55min lock) Locking Notes: Green arms: x-arm looked off in pitch and mostly improved via TMSx in +pit but then let INCREASE FLASHES run for both arms. ALSy would have its alignment driven off so quickly took down and tweaked up mainly via tmsy (still not great but made it) DRMI: Had to go to PRMI. Still looked off so touched PRM and then BS in pitch (due to AS flashes) & it locked. During ASC offload AS camera went from pitch misalignment to yaw misalignment on the camera and it stuck with that as ASC offloaded. For DRMI eventually locked after 4+min but.... 1702 DRMI Lockloss (non-DOWN) 1757 Back to NLN 1921 Incoming M5.9 Fiji EQ alert---No issues riding through it. 2036-2037 Accidental Drop from OBSERVING due to Operator Error For the next lock there is currently an ISC_LOCK notification saying ""ALS_XARM: STOLEN by USER"" 2100-2132 Calibration 2221 Lockloss (after a 4hr24min lock) ALS locking once again was not smooth. Required several rounds of INCREASE FLASHES. And even after that when the arms would lock they would have noticeable oscillations (for the y-arm the powers had a 5sec period oscillation which would cause a lockloss) But ISC LOCK eventually moved on. DRMI had flashes but similar to last lock it wasn't quite there. I took H1 straight to CHECK MICH FRINGES after a few minutes and rest of ISC_LOCK was automated. 2329 OBSERVING 2349 PI24 begins ringing up & was damped down within a couple minutes.

These changes aimed to investigate whether we could reduce the amplitude of a peak around 540 Hz observed in DARM which we suspect may be associated with input jitter noise coupling into DARM. At approximately 17:23 UTC we began by reducing the ring heater (RH) power per segment on ITMY from 0.53 W to 0.50 W. After one hour around 18:24 UTC we increased the power on the ETMX ring heaters per segment from 0.2 W to 0.3 W. Finally at about 19:52 UTC we changed the TCS setting of the ETMY RH per segment from 0.11 W to 0.05 W. While adjusting the RH settings we monitored the effects on various parameters including sideband power buildup in the PRC the interferometer reflectivity and the optical gain. We would expect these values to be stable if all variables remained constant. Here are some notable observations: 1) The optical gain increased by approximately 1% following the RH changes. 2) The PRC power buildups at 9 MHz and 45 MHz decreased by approximately 1.5% to 2%. 3) There may have been a slight improvement in optical gain of less than 1%. 4) The power in the Power Recycling Cavity (POP_A_LF) and the interferometer reflected power (REFL_A_LF) increased although the effect was minimal for both signals. 5) Power at the AS port as measured by the AS_C QPD showed a decrease with actual counts dropping about 200 to 210 representing a reduction of around 5%. Overall the changes in the different signals observed in the first plot were relatively small across most buildups with the optical gain showing a slight increase or remaining stable during the RH setting changes for ITMY ETMX and ETMY. In the second attachment we present the DARM data between 520 and 900 Hz along with the changes in the height of the hump around 540 Hz following each adjustment to the relative humidity (RH) settings. It appears that the most significant effect on the amplitude of the 540 Hz hump occurred after the reduction of the ETMY RH power (indicated by the blue trace). This effect was more pronounced compared to the changes observed 1 hour after the IY RH adjustment (green) and 1 hour after the EX RH adjustment (orange/brown). In the third attachment we present the DARM jitter coherence. The power spectra for the DARM and IMC WFS A are shown in the second and third plots because they serve as the best indicators for measuring input jitter. The first plot displays the coherence between IMC WFS A and DARM as well as the coherence between PEM PSL PERISCOPE and DARM. We observe approximately 0.7 coherence between the IMC WFS A I PIT and the PEM PSL PERISCOPE X with DARM and around 0.5 coherence between the IMC WFS A I YAW and DARM.

Overall we did not make the situation worse so we saved these RH values in the TCS_config.py file to relock the IFO with these settings. ,"{'term': 'L1 TCS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",74213,karla.ramirez@ligo.org

Five seconds after the lock loss the MC2 suspension watchdog tripped and remained in this state until I received a one-hour lost lock call which required human intervention. Microseism noise is slightly higher than the last time the interferometer (IFO) lost lock and subsequently relocked so I wonder if this contributes to the IFO's difficulty in locking as quickly as before. Please refer to the attached document for more details. Over the last hour the IFO has struggled to reach a low noise state. It lost lock twice during the TURN_ON_DHARD phase and once during the SWITCH_ESD_TO_LOW_NOISE state. Currently the IFO is attempting to lock again and I hope it will succeed this time.

There are a few more plots to support Huyen's statement that it doesn't seem much better. I've attached 3 pdfs- The first is for a large microseism before the second is a big set of plot from after and the third set is the right place to look first to compare the before/ after. The before/after has 2 sets of 4 plots. The ""after"" time is for a large microseism - this is sept 27 2024 7:00 UTC - the IFO has finally locked after such large microseismic motion that it could not acquire lock. plots 1-4 are from ""before"" and 5-8 are ""after"" Plot 1/5 - Ground motion ASD. The microseism is big. Plot 2/6 - The top trace is the table Z velocity seem by the GS-13s. subplots 2 & 3 are the residual velocity for X & Y. In the ""before"" time the motion on the 50 sec time scale is pretty terrible. It's bettern in plot 6 for the After time. BUT - the motion at the microseism in Z and the residual at the microsiesm for X&Y are about the same. The ""after"" plot on pg 6 shows clear residual (excess) motion for X&Y at the microseism. Here you can see that the level of Z motion and the level of X & Y residual is about the same. This is consistent with a 0.1 rad/meter coupling from Z into rX and rY for the GS-13s - because g/w^2 is about 10 meter/rad at 160 mHz. This 10% is consistent with the TFs in the next 2 plots but not really consistent with the expectations of reduced coupling we should get from the precision calibration Huyen did. Note - These plots are in Band Limited velocity (nm/sec). There is a lowpass filter at 30 mHz and a highpass filter at 1 Hz to help emphasize the microseism. In the full plot sets you can see that in tilt the signal on the CPS and GS-13 is sensor noise limited below about 100 mHz and above about 1 Hz (pgs 49 50 52 53) Plot 3/7 - TF from GS-13 Z to GS-13 RX. around the microseism there is excellent coherence and the TF is around 0.1 to 0.25 between 0.1 and 0.3 Hz plot 4/8 - TF from GS-13Z to GS-13 RY - very much like the RX TFs.

There are no new points for ITMX since the coherence for the bias drive bias off measurement was 0.07 which is below the threshold of 0.1 that we have set. We had previously concluded ( 79597 ) that this may be because of no charge build-up on the test mass assuming that we are calculating our coherences correctly. Previous issue with measurement processing script: There had been some issues with processing the In-Lock SUS Charge Measurements for this past week so I looked at the script and was able to fix the issue. Originally the way that the script would figure out whether it needs to run a measurement or whether it had already been processed is that it would make a list of all the measurements that occurred during the entered time period (default is the past month) and a list of all processed measurements that occurred during the entered time period and then uses nested for loops to check whether a processed file existed for each data file. That normally works fine but in this case the last time we had gotten and processed measurements was over one month ago so when the script tried making a list of the processed files from within the last month there weren't any and the list was blank. Then when it tried to iterate over each data file and then over each processed file it would skip the entire processed file iteration because the list was empty. The range over which it looks for unprocessed files can be changed or set to look at all files in each directory but that shouldn't be required in this/most cases so I edited the script. I added in a catch for when the coefficient file list is empty for it to run all measurements in the data directory list.

18448,H1 SUS - Suspension watchdog trips during the large earthquake,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81668,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Sun, 08 Dec 2024 13:56:19 -0800",Back in March ( 76269 ) Jeff and I had updated all the suspension watchdogs (besides OFIS OPOS and HXDS since those were already up to date) to use better blrms filtering and to be output into um. We set the suspension watchdog thresholds to values between 100 and 300 µm but these values were set arbitrarily since there was no way to previously see how far the stages move during different scenarios. We had upped a few of the thresholds after having some suspensions trip when they probably shouldn't have and this is a continuation of that. During the large earthquake that hit us on December 5th 2024 18:46 UTC all ISI watchdogs tripped as well as some of the stages on several suspensions. After a cursory look all suspensions that tripped only had either the bottom or bottom+penultimate stage trip meaning that with the exception of the single suspensions the others' M1 stage damping should have stayed on. We wanted to go through and check whether the trips may have just been because of the movement from the ISIs tripping. If that is the case we want to raise the suspension watchdog thresholds for those stages so that these suspensions don't trip every single time their ISI trips especially if the amount that they are moving is still not very large. Suspension stages that tripped: Triples: - MC3 M3 - PR3 M2 M3 - SRM M2 M3 - SR2 M2 M3 Singles: - IM1 M1 - OFI M1 - TMSX M1 MC3 (M3) ( ndscope1 ) When the earthquake hit and we lost lock all stages were moving due to the earthquake but once HAM2 ISI tripped 5 seconds after the lockloss the rate at which the OSEMs were moving quickly accelerated so the excess motion looks to mainly be due to the ISI trip ( ndscope2 ). Stage Original WD threshold Max BLRMS reached after lockloss New WD threshold M1 150 86 150 (unchanged) M2 150 136 175 M3 150 159 200 PR3 (M2 M3) ( ndscope3 ) Looks to be the same issue as with MC3. Stage Original WD threshold Max BLRMS reached after lockloss New WD threshold M1 150 72 150 (unchanged) M2 150 162 200 M3 150 151 200 SRM (M2 M3) ( ndscope4 ) Once again the OSEMs are moving after the lockloss due to the earthquake but the rate they were moving at greatly increased once HAM5 saturated and the ISI watchdogs tripped. Stage Original WD threshold Max BLRMS reached after lockloss New WD threshold M1 150 84 150 (unchanged) M2 150 165 200 M3 150 174 225 SR2 (M2 M3) ( ndscope5 ) Again the OSEMs are moving after the lockloss due to the earthquake but the rate they were moving at greatly increased once HAM4 saturated and the ISI watchdogs tripped. Stage Original WD threshold Max BLRMS reached after lockloss New WD threshold M1 150 102 150 (unchanged) M2 150 182 225 M3 150 171 225 IM1 (M1) ( ndscope6 ) Again the OSEMs are moving after the lockloss due to the earthquake but the rate they were moving at greatly increased once HAM2 saturated and the ISI watchdogs tripped. Stage Original WD threshold Max BLRMS reached after lockloss New WD threshold M1 150 175 225 OFI (M1) ( ndscope7 ) Again the OSEMs are moving after the lockloss due to the earthquake but the rate they were moving at greatly increased once HAM5 saturated and the ISI watchdogs tripped. Stage Original WD threshold Max BLRMS reached after lockloss New WD threshold M1 150 209 250 TMSX (M1) ( ndscope8 ) This one seems a bit questionable - it looks like some of the OSEMs were already moving quite a bit before the ISI tripped and there isn't as much of a clear place where they started moving more once the ISI had tripped( ndscope9 ). I will still be raising the suspension trip threshold for this one just because it doesn't need to be raised very much and is within a reasonable range.

I trended the ALSX channels alongside the EX VEA temperatures and it looks like a couple of the temperatures went down section D down by almost one degree F right around when we started having crystal frequency issues. The wind also was blowing into the VEA which we know since the dust counts were high then. I believe it's possible that the wind was cooling down the air in the part of the VEA near where we have the ALS box and changing the temperature of the crystal enough to affect the beatnote. I only have this one screenshot right now ( ndscope ) but I had trended back a few months and seen a possible correlation between when we get into the CHECK_CRYSTAL_FREQUENCY state for ALSX the temperature inside the EX VEA and the dust counts indicating wind entering the VEA. It's hard to know for sure especially because the air/wind outside is now much colder than it was a couple months ago but it would be interesting to know the location of the D section and look for these correlations more closely. tagging ISC LOG: 22:15 started an initial alignment 22:40 initial alignment done relocking - ALSX beatnote issue - CHECK_CRYSTAL_FREQUENCY - toggled force/no force - finally caught with no force - ALSX beatnote issue again - toggled force/no force and enable/disable 00:01 Put ifo in DOWN since we can't get past DRMI due to the high microseism 00:29 tried relocking 01:06 back to DOWN 02:38 Trying relocking again Start Time System Name Location Lazer_Haz Task Time End 23:03 PEM Robert LVEA YES Finish setting up for Monday 23:48 ISC ,"{'term': 'H1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81673,oli.patane@ligo.org

Since 10/16/2024 there have been 10 instances where M3 WD trips during SRC align during initial alignment which have caused a total loss of 1hr and 49 mins of locking time. While this isn't a lot the trending WD trips for SRM shows that this is a more recent occurrence. Out of the 31 total M3 SRM WD trips since start of O4b (and not counting vent) 12 happened in the last 5 weeks with 10 of these being during initial alignment (i.e. this type of trip). Since the rise of this issue we have gone through a total of 112 initial alignments meaning it's occurred in 9% of initial alignments. Doesn't sound like a lot but if guardian has an initial alignment during an OWL shift this suggests a 1/10 chance of being woken up just to press ""untrip"". Sometimes M3 is too rung up in this state that untripping takes 20 mins but other times it only takes 1-2 mins.

Next Steps: The possible cause per a last convo with TJ was that guardian thinks that SRC is aligned when actually it is locked to the wrong mode causing the SRM controls to go awry when re-misaligning during initial alignment - so just rehash that conversation when possible.

TJ and I were investigating it earlier and had early thoughts that SRM was catching on the wrong mode during SRC alignment in ALIGN_IFO either during the re-alignment of SRM (pre-SRC align) or after the re-misalignment of SRM. This results in the guardian thinking that SRC is aligned which results in saturations and trips because it's actually not. Again we think this is the case as of 11/25 but still investigating.

In any LIGO cluster terminal or Jupyter we can use igwn-py kernel and import just the following dependency:from spectrums Import *# define a time segment object:time_seg = time_segment()In the prompt this will ask to enter a ref_time (reference time) this would be gps time when OSEMs were known to have no anomalies. Once pressed enter it will ask for check_time this would be another gps time which is being checked against ref_time. Finally it will ask to enter duration. For a long duration this might take a long time to execute. Keeping duration =180 (in seconds) is a reasonable choice.This will create a time segment object as a dictionary.Now we can either check the OSEM fluctuations directly by running the following command:host = 'nds.ligo-wa.caltech.edu'osem_fluctuations(time_segments = time_seg host=host)This will show us available OSEMs and we can enter at least one or a list of OSEMs that we wish to investigate. It may take a few minutes to get all the plots. Checking individual OSEMs might be time consuming a quick alternative is to check their BLRM values first:check_blrms(time_segments = time_seg host=host fs = 256 lowcut = 15 highcut = 20 threshold = None)Runing this function allows us to enter either one or a list of OSEMs like before to have their BLRM values printed.

Oberling R. Short This afternoon Jason and I started to look into why the FSS has been struggling to relock itself recently. In short once the autolocker finds a RefCav resonance it's been able to grab it but loses it after about a second. This happens repeatedly sometimes taking up to 45 minutes for the autolocker to finally grab and hold resonance on its own (which led me to do this manually twice yesterday). We first noticed the autolocker struggling when recovering the FSS after the most recent NPRO swap on November 22nd which led Jason to manually lock it in that instance. While looking at trends of when the autolocker both fails and is successful in locking the RefCav we noticed that the fastmon channel looks the most different between the two cases. In a successful RefCav lock ( attachment 1 ) the fastmon channel will start drifting away from zero as the PZT works to center on the resonance but once the temperature loop turns on the signal is brought back and eventually settles back around zero. In unsuccessful RefCav lock attempts (attachments 2 and 3 ) the fastmon channel will still drift away but then lose resonance once the signal hits +/-13V (the limit of the PZT as set by the electronics within the TTFSS box) before the temploop is able to turn on. I also looked back to a successful FSS lock with the NPRO installed before this one (before the problems with the autolocker started attachment 4 ) and the behavior looks much the same as with successful locks with the current NPRO. It seems that with this NPRO for some reason the PZT is frequently running out of range when trying to center on the RefCav resonance before the temploop can turn on to help but it sometimes gets lucky. Jason and I took some time familiarizing ourselves with the autolocker code (written in C and unchanged in over a decade) to give us a better idea of what it's doing. At this point we're still not entirely sure what about this NPRO is causing the PZT to run out of range but we do have some ideas of things to try during a maintenance window to make the FSS lock faster: Reduce delay turning on temploop (state 2 currently 1.0 sec) Increase wait time for mode to be centered (state 1 currently 0.1 sec LLO uses 5.0 sec) Allow more voltage to PZT (requires using newer version of TTFSS box) Current TTFSS limits PZT voltage to 13V-15V max HV capable of supplying up to 65V PZT capable of running up to 65V-100V ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81780,ryan.short@ligo.org

18581,H1 ISC - Test mass motion from ASC drives,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81769,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Wed, 11 Dec 2024 15:25:12 -0800","This alog presents the first steps I am taking into answering the question: ""what is the calibrated residual test mass motion from the ASC?"" As a reminder the arm alignment control is run in the common/differential hard/soft basis so we have eight total loops governing the angular motion of the test masses: pitch and yaw for differential hard/soft and common hard/soft. These degrees of freedom are diagonalized in actuation via the ASC drive matrix. The signals from each of these ASC degrees of freedom are then sent to each of the four test masses where the signal is fed ""up"" from the input of the TST ISC filter banks through the PUM/UIM/TOP locking filters banks (I annotated this screenshot of the ITM suspension medm for visualization). No pitch or yaw actuation is sent to the TST or UIM stages at Hanford. The ASC drive to the pum is filtered through some notches/bandstops for various suspension modes. The ASC drive to the TOP acquires all of these notches and bandstops and an additional integrator and low pass filter meaning that the top mass actuates in angle at very low frequency only (sub 0.5 Hz). Taking this all into account involves a lot of work so to just get something off the ground I am only thinking about ASC drive to the PUM in this post. With a little more time I can incorporate the drive to the top mass stage as well. Thinking only about the PUM makes this a ""simple"" problem: we know exactly what the ASC drive is in counts- we just measure the ""H1:ASC-[DOF]_[P/Y]_OUT_DQ"" channel We propagate drive that to each test mass knowing the drive matrix we have set screenshots of the pitch matrix and yaw matrix We calibrate this from drive counts to Newton*meters knowing the drive calibration from G1100968 for PUM: 40 V /2**20 ct [DAC] * 0.268 mA / V [drive strength] * 0.0309 N / A [force coeff] * 70.7 mm [lever arm] pit/yaw lever arm is the same for the PUM I conveniently chose a time from before the ETMX DAC change to avoid thinking too hard about the DAC counts We transform this N*m PUM drive to radians of test mass motion using the PUM-TST state space suspension model transfer function which is calibrated into real units I did all of this in python so I used Kevin's exported quad state space model found here: T2300299 I used the damped model which applies the ETMX top mass damping filters I have done just this to achieve the four plots I have attached to this alog. These plots show the ITM and ETM test mass motion in rad/rtHz from each degree of freedom and the overall radian RMS value. That is each trace is showing you exactly how much radians of motion each ASC degree of freedom is sending to the test mass through the PUM drive. The drive matrix value is the same in magnitude for each ITM and each ETM meaning that the ""ITM"" plot is true for both ITMX and ITMY (the drives might differ by an overall sign though). Since I am just looking at the PUM I also didn't include the drive notches. Once I add in the top mass drive I will make sure I capture the various drive filters properly. Some commentary: These plots make it very evident how different the drive is from each ASC degree of freedom. This is confusing because in principle we know that the ""HARD"" and ""SOFT"" plants are the same for common and differential and could use the same control design. However we know that the sensor noise at the REFL WFS which controls CHARD is different than the sensor noise at the AS WFS that control DHARD so even with exact same controller we would see different overall drives. We also know that we don't use the same control design for each DOF due to the sensor noise limitations and also the randomness of commissioning that has us updating each ASC controller at different times for different reasons. For example the soft loops both run on the TMS QPDs but still have different drive levels. Some action items: besides continuing the process of getting all the drives from all stages properly calibrated we can start thinking again about our ASC design and how to improve it. I think two standout items are the SOFT P and CHARD Y noise above 10 Hz on these plots. Also the fact that the overall RMS from each loop varies is something that warrants more investigation. I think this is probably related to the differing control designs sensor noise and noise from things like HAM1 motion or PR3 bosems. So one thing I can do is project the PR3 damping noise that we think dominates the REFL WFS RMS into test mass motion.

A moment or so after there is a glitch in those channels there is a range drop in DARM.

I completed a series of LASSO investigations around this time in the hopes that such a sharp feature would make it easier for LASSO to identify correlations. I find a number of trend channels that have drastic changes at the same time as this turn-off point related to TCS-ITMY_CO2 ALS-Y_WFS and SUS-MC3_M1. The runs I completed are linked here: LASSO run of the first half of Dec 11 with the sensemon range as the primary channel LASSO run of times near the turn-off point with TCS-ITMY_CO2 as the primary channel LASSO run of times near the turn-off point with the sensemon range as the primary channel Run #1 was a generic run of LASSO in the hopes of identifying a correlation. While no channel was highlighted as strongly correlated to the entire time period this run does identify H1:TCS-ITMY_CO2_QPD_B_SEG2_OUTPUT (rank 11) and H1:TCS-ITMY_CO2_QPD_B_SEG2_INMON (rank 15) as having a drastic feature at the turn-off point (example figure ). Based on this information I launched targeted runs #2 and #3. Run #2 is a run of LASSO using H1:TCS-ITMY_CO2_QPD_B_SEG2_OUTPUT as the primary channel to correlate against. This was designed to identify any additional channels that may show a drastic change in behavior at the same time. Channels of interest from this run include H1:ALS-Y_WFS_B_DC_SEG3_OUT16 ( example figure ) and H1:ALS-Y_WFS_B_DC_MTRX_Y_OUTMON ( example figure ). SEISMON channels were also found to be correlated but this is likely a coincidence. Run #3 targets the same turn-on point but with the standard sensemon range as the primary channel. This run revealed an additional channel with a change in behavior at the time of interest H1:SUS-MC3_M1_DAMP_P_INMON ( example figure ). Based on these runs the TCS-IMTY_CO2 and ALS-Y_WFS channels are the best leads for additional investigations into the source of this glitching.

The calibration involved adjusting the temperature loop set point and monitoring the corresponding changes in PMC temperature and length. The results were validated using previous measurements and compared to similar evaluations at LLO. Additionally the necessity of the heater for JAC operations was assessed highlighting it would be needed for long term operation. Details PMC Heater Calibration The calibration of the PMC heater was conducted. The PMC remained locked while the temperature loop set point was adjusted from the usual 3.7V to 1.7V. This adjustment corresponds to a PMC length change of 0.30 μm based on a prior measurement ( alog entry 81385 ). A PMC temperature change of 0.023 K was recorded using the thermometer. From this result the thermal expansion coefficient was calculated as: 0.30 μm / 0.023 K = 13 μm/K This result is consistent with the thermal expansion coefficient of aluminum 22e-6/K and the approximate PMC length of 0.5 m. No significant changes in heater output were detected before and after the set point adjustment. First Plot Description: Top panel: PZT input calibrated for PMC length. Middle panel: PMC temperature measured with the thermometer. Bottom panel: Heater output with histograms shown for the middle and bottom panels. Reference to LLO Calibration To further calibrate the PMC heater the LLO heater calibration ( alog entry 51467 attached plot ) was used as a reference. At LLO heater input changes from 2.5V to 4V resulted in PMC temperature changes from 292.2 K to 291.125 K indicating a heater efficiency of \(0.67 \ \text{K}/\text{V}\). Using this efficiency the PMC expansion rate per heater voltage was calculated as: 13 μm/K × 0.67 K/V = 8.7 μm/V Monthly Drift Analysis With this calibration the monthly heater output was evaluated. Second Plot Description: Top panel: Heater-induced temperature actuation (left axis) and the corresponding PMC expansion (right axis). Bottom panel: Required PZT input for equivalent actuation without the heater. Periodic large spikes were observed daily. However since each spike occurred within approximately 10 seconds as shown in the attached screenshot these spikes are not attributed to actual temperature changes. A moving median (red line) was applied to highlight the spikes. Note that this moving median is not an ideal representation as the extracted data is already averaged over 1-minute intervals. However it is still useful for illustrating the spikes. Despite the spikes the heater compensated for a length change equivalent to approximately 500 V in PZT input is typical day-time drift but sometime it can drift more than 1000V in a day. A 10-day analysis of LLO PMC showed no spikes and the results were consistent with LHO data. Result is shown in the third plot as same structure as the second plot. Implications for JAC Operations The PZT can be railed in a day from this measurement so we would need the heater for JAC operation. Additional Observations Spikes observed at LHO caused glitches in transmitted power as shown in the attached plot and may require resolution. Redesigning the filters could potentially mitigate these anomalies. PSL ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81756,masayuki.nakano@ligo.org

This beam has been clipped at least since the O4 break due to various reasons (in this particular alog we tried to fix it but then undid the fix I'm adding here so we have a general time reference for when we first noticed the problem: 76291 ). As a result the PRG calibration for O4b has been fishy since it is normalized by the IM4 trans QPD power. Today with the beam properly centered I checked the PRG calibration to make sure it's still good. Craig did this after ITMY was replaced: 58327 . I followed his same steps with help from Ryan S and Sheila. First we ran initial alignment on the y arm which uses the green camera references. We waited until that alignment was converged and then stepped through the input_align_yarm states in the ALIGN_IFO guardian. I recorded the IM4 trans value as well as the y arm transmission value. When we run a normal initial alignment we lock input align with the x arm so I used that opportunity to similarly record the x arm transmission value and IM4 trans. As a note: the green input alignment references are set when we converge the full IFO ASC therefore I believe the single arm alignment after we run the green initial alignment is probably very close to the full IFO alignment. Then we paused in DARM_TO_DC_READOUT in the ISC LOCK guardian this is just after all the full IFO ASC converges at 2W. I grabbed the x and y arm transmission values and IM4 trans. Channels: H1:IMC-IM4_TRANS_NSUM_OUT16 H1:LSC-TR_X_NORM_OUT16 H1:LSC_TR_Y_NORM_OUT16 Single arm lock values: Y-arm trans: 0.91 IM4 trans: 1.95 X-arm trans: 1.01 IM4 trans: 1.98 Full lock values: Y-arm trans: 1684 X-arm trans: 1708 IM4 trans: 1.98 Calculation: PRM transmission = 0.031 PRG = Tp * Y-arm trans (full ifo) / Y-arm trans (yarm only) * Input power (yarm only) / Input power (full ifo) (copied directly from Craig's alog) PRG from Y arm = 56.5 PRG from X arm = 54.0 PRG reported from H1:LSC-PR_GAIN_OUT16 at the 2W lock time: 54 Therefore I think our PRG calibration is correct.

Today Sheila and I discussed locking without the FE triggering at all and just having the ALIGN_IFO node see good flashes and turn on the necessary filters and banks. I tried this out today but I wasn't able to get it to lock any more reliably than what we have now. No matter the method it would seem to catch with low AS_A values ~2500 on NSUM vs the normal 5000. From here SRM would start to be driven before it would realize that it wasn't quite locked. I tried adding some code in ACQUIRE_SRY to try to turn on and off the SRM M1 LOCK L input and the SRCL FM4 filters and even clear the history if necessary but this didn't work without long settling periods between attempts. I ended up keeping the ISC_library.is_locked('SRY') looking as AS_A_DC_NSUM_OUTPUT > 4000. This value is a bit higher but safer. It will let the node run through Down and reset drives integrators and let SRM settle a bit. I don't think this is a fix barely even a band aid. It will need some more thought on how to only catch on the correct mode. ,"{'term': 'H1 GRD', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81747,thomas.shaffer@ligo.org

These Thermoflex1400 chillers have their flow rate adjusted by opening or closing a 3 way valve at the back of the chiller. for both X and Y chillers these have been in the full open position with the lever pointed straight up. The Y chiller has been running with 4.0gpm so our only change was a lower flow rate. The X chiller has been at 3.7gpm already and the manual states that these chillers shouldn't be ran below 3.8gpm. Though this was a small note in the manual and could be easily missed. Since the flow couldn't be increased via the 3 way valve on back I didn't want to lower it further and left it as is. Two questions came from this: Why are we running so close to the 3.8gpm minimum? Why is the flow rate for the X chiller so low? The flow rate has been consistent for the last year+ so I don't suspect that the pumps are getting worn out. As far back as I can trend they have been around 4.0 and 3.7 with some brief periods above or below. TCS ,"{'term': 'H1 PEM', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81745,thomas.shaffer@ligo.org

In production it was replaced with a W2275 (aka oaf FE). Please see Jonathan's alog for details. After h0epics was moved its iocs were started by hand as per wiki instructions: dust monitors (lvea lab ey ex dr) weather stations (ex ey mx my) and 3ifo dewpoint sensor. WP12236 New RGC and Timing Card h1omc0 Jonathan Erik EJ Marc Daniel Dave: h1omc0 was upgraded to a custom RCG5.30 and a new LIGO Timing Card (ver1589). This will permit changing the Duotone frequency from 960961Hz to 19201921Hz in conjection with LLO next week. Erik verified the duotone is currently unchanged at 960961Hz. Please see Erik's alog for details. The RCG upgrade of h1iopomc0 added one slow channel to the DAQ INI (H1:FEC-179_TIMING_CARD_TEMP_DEG_C). A DAQ restart was required which permitted an EDC change for several pending WPs (marked as *). WP12243 Slow Controls Timing Card Version Check Daniel Daniel changed the slow-controls Beckhoff code to permit the following versions of the LIGO timing card in the FE IO-Chassis Ver Desc 496 Standard first version timing card 1000 New LIGO DAC timing card 1589 Variable DuoTone frequency timing card The code was restarted at 10:19. This fixed the persistant EX timing error due to h1susex TCver=1000 and preempted a corner station h1omc0 error with TCver=1589. WP12164 Add new Guardian PCALX_STAT channels to DAQ* Tony TJ Dave: The new PCALX_STAT guardian node's DAQ channels were added to the EDC as part of the DAQ restart. WP12195 Add missing CDSRFM slow channel to DAQ* Dave: A new H1EPICS_CDSRFM.ini was loaded adding the missing channel H1:CDS-RFM_LRS_EX2CS_CHCNT WP12185 add VACSTAT slow channels to DAQ* Dave: A new H1EPICS_VACSTAT.ini added the new state channels to the DAQ. CDS Hardware Status IOC Erik Dave: Following the upgrade of h1omc0's timing card the CDS HW stat reported problems with this card. We found that one unused bit in the LPTC_STATUS PV was unset in h1omc0 and set in all the other front ends including h1susex. All FE except h1omc0 LPTC_STATUS = 0x4fbf ee00 (bit 16 set) h1omc0 LPTC_STATUS = 0x4fbe ee00 (bit 16 unset) Now that Daniel has fixed the TCver error in EX the temporary code in cds_status_ioc.py to verify the only EX error is the TCver error was removed. DAQ Restart Jonathan Erik EJ Dave: The DAQ was restarted primarily for the h1iopomc0 INI change due to its RCG upgrade. Several EDC changes which have been waiting for target-of-opportunity were also done. This was a messy DAQ restart. Adding h1omc0 to the custom RCG boot server h1vmboot0 inadvertently changed the DAQ FE list to only include two frontends h1susex and h1omc0. When the 0-leg was started initially DC0 looked good but then we noticed that on the CDS overview only the DC0 EPICS channels for omc0 and susex were connecting and Jonathan found GDS0 had lost a lot of channels. Around this time I also restarted the EDC on h1susauxb123 and also found that the expected number of channels was down by about 1000. At this time FW0 was writing tiny frames (only two frontends). DC0s DAQ configuration was fixed and the 0-leg was restarted. At this point the EDC was out of sync so it was restarted. This then generated a new H1EDC.ini which necessitated a third and final 0-leg restart (plus another GDS0). The 1-leg restart was a single restart with a GDS1 restart also needed. Change of RCG reporting color on CDS Overview Dave: We now have two front end systems in production which are running with a custom version of the RCG. To highlight this I have changed the non-standard-RCG indicator color from purple to black on the CDS Overview.

Dave Jonathan] h1omc0 was upgraded to support alternative duotone frequencies. A new parameter was added to the iop model h1iopomc0 'duotone_frequency' currently set to '960' which configures the duotone frequency to 960/961 Hz the standard frequencies. The h1omc0 front end was moved from a the primary bootserver h1vmboot1 to the secondary bootserver h1vmboot0 using changes to the puppet configuration. All models for h1omc0 were built and installed from RCG source rather than packages. The git commit of the RCG source is tagged as 'h1_2024_12_10_variable_duotone'. The omc0 front end and io chassis were shut down. The timing card SN S2101117 was replaced with SN S2101084 which had newer firmware version 1589 that supports alternative duotone frequencies. The IO chassis and front-end were restarted. A few problems were encountered: Running puppet on the secondary bootserver overwrote the DAQ master template and some EDC INI files. The master file problem was revealed in the DAQ overview where most of the front ends were reporting no channels. The EDC overwrite showed up as too few total EDC channels. Running the puppet configuration on the production server re-enabled DHCP for hosts that were supposed to boot from the secondary bootserver. These had to be manually commented out from the DHCPD configuration then the service restarted. To change the duotone to 1920 Hz edit the h1ipomc0 model set 'duotone_frequency=1920' in the parameter block save the model.

Unsure of the lock loss cause as maintenance activities had started. We aimed to see if the 59Hz coupling to DARM peak changed (needs ~20 minutes+ of data) but the accelerators showed that by increasing the CO2 power dumped in the water cooled beam dump the load on the chillers changed and the 59Hz peak moved ~0.1Hz which means that it would be very difficult to see in DARM. 15:41 Turned CO2X and CO2Y power output down to 0W. 15:51 closed iris at bottom of CO2Y periscope (there is no place in VP for guillotine) 16:01 onwards Robert was doing backscatter tests on HAM3 making IFO glitches/noise 1624 Opened CO2Y irirs IFO lost lost lock In attached plot can see that the SQZ (especially at high frequency) got worse without CO2s. The SQZ ASC also changed the alignment mainly in YAW does that mean that the CO2s need some alignment improvements in YAW? Looking at HWS signals the optics substrate absorption changes as expected and started to level out although the simulation didn't expect them too level out yet. In future to repeat this test we could dump to 1.7W going into DARM using a normal beam-dump to dump the 1.7W before the periscope so that the load on the chiller isn't changed but the CO2 is not on being injected and anything that could backscatter light after the periscope is blocked. Alternatively we could shake the table. Still the VPs themselves could be a source of scatter as are only AR coated at 10.6um meaning they reflect up to 15% of 1064nm per surface DCC D1100439 .

My hypothesis was that the Camera servos were coupling the SOFT loops to the HARD loops in a parallel configuration such that they are adding (can be additive of subtractive) and I did an ON/OFF test measuring DHARD Y and CHARD Y with camera servo filter that reduced the gain around 0.4 Hz by 20dB. The DHARD Y loop has much higher gain than CHARD. I found no evidence of coupling there and it may be just the coupling is smaller than I had modelled. As for CHARD Y I projected would have a UGF at around 0.4 Hz [ 73035 ] but I see some notch like feature that could be what I am looking for but in my stupidity I only have a measurement with my altered Camera servo control (so no ON/OFF test). I'd want to double check if this feature changes with camera servo control change. Regardless of whether I am hypothesising anything sane this is a very strange feature and definitely a sign of some unwanted coupling.

18671,L1 ISC - Comment to ESD control spectra during ALS_DIFF,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=74466,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Wed, 11 Dec 2024 16:50:51 -0600",Some commentary on this data with implications for the required ESD range for the 100 kg test mass. First some explanation of the interferometer state during this time series. At the beginning of the time series plot when the ESD signals are flat the ALS system is providing only common mode feedback to the main laser frequency. The ALS differential control starts just after -19m when the differential feedback is applied to the two ETM ESDs only. The main signal content here is the microseism (5 sec period when this data was taken the microseism was relatively high). Some time before -18m the ALS DIFF feedback is also applied to the UIMs and the ALS DIFF bandwidth is increased to achieve a UGF of 12 Hz this is why the low-frequency content of the ESD signal is reduced and the high-freq content is increased. In principle it should be possible to apply the ALS DIFF feedback to both the ESD and UIM stages right at the beginning to avoid this transient getting applied to the ESD. Note that each ESD signal has an offset +180000 for ETMX and -160000 for ETMY. These are 20-bit DACs so that’s out of a DAC range of +/- 524288. In each case the bias (not shown) is at maximum and of the opposite sign of the signal offset (so -524000 for ETMX). The combination of bias and signal offset sort of maximizes the force available. The force applied by the ESD is: Force = alpha*(V_bias - V_signal)^2 where alpha is a coefficient that is determined by the electrode geometry and is of order 1e-11 N/V^2. The bias and signal channels are all going through the high-voltage ES driver which has a gain of 40. The conversion from DAC counts to voltage applied to the ESD electrodes is: 7.63e-4 V/count. Using these factors I calculate the force range used during acquisition: 1. Including the transient between -19m and -18m. Max force : Signal = 240000 cnt -> 183 V Fmax/alpha = (583 V)^2 = 3.4e5 V^2 Min force: Signal = 60000 cnt -> 46 V Fmin/alpha = (446 V)^2 = 2e5 V^2 Force range = alpha * 1.4e5 V^2 2. Omitting the transient (since it could be mitigated). Max force : Signal = 220000 cnt -> 168 V Fmax/alpha = (568 V)^2 = 3.23e5 V^2 Min force: Signal = 149000 cnt -> 114 V Fmin/alpha = (514 V)^2 = 2.64e5 V^2 Force range = alpha * 5.9e4 V^2 These numbers can be compared to the force range available which is: alpha*(800 V)^2 = alpha*6.4e5 V^2 (In fact the outputs don’t go all the way to the +/-400 V rails so the range is probably ~10% smaller). So including the transient the acquisition uses about 22% of the full range while after the transient it uses about 10% of the full range. Currently for the BHQS (the suspension for the 100 kg test mass) we're considering a test mass and reaction mass size that would provide an ESD range when normalized by the mass of about 60% of the current range (keeping the gap between the test mass and reaction mass at 5 mm). So although this is a smaller (force/mass) than we have now it should be quite sufficient for lock acquisition.,"{'term': 'L1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",74466,peter.fritschel@ligo.org

We have been analyzing loud glitches and their correlation with ERM PDs (alog 72968 ). The results so far are as follows: Correlation with ERM PDs: Over 70% of loud glitches (with SNR>300) are correlated with spikes in the ERM PDs Independence of X and Y Arms: The correlation occurs either with the X arm or the Y arm but not both simultaneously. This suggests that the events are independent (alog 73024 ) Analysis of Individual PDs: At least three PDs show a significant correlation in over 80% of cases. This conclusion holds true for both arms as the analysis was done separately for the X and Y arms (alog 73447 ) Dominance of Bottom PD (PD3): In 60.2% of cases the bottom PD (PD3) has the largest SNR in the X arm. Similarly in 68% of cases PD3 has the largest SNR in the Y arm. The reason for this behavior is still unclear. Since all the analyses point toward the hypothesis of dust particles scattering light near the ERM we calculated the dust size required to scatter light onto the PDs based on its distance. For this we used the Fraunhofer approximation with scattering at an scattering angle θ = 0. We analyzed two specific scenarios: (i) when there is a weak signal (0.1 count) in a PD during a loud glitch and (ii) when there is a strong signal (10 counts) in a PD during a loud glitch. Figures 1 and 2 show the results for cases (i) and (ii) respectively. They show that particles measuring 10–50 microns located approximately 0.2–4 meters in front of the ETMs can cause signals in the AERM PDs. We are also investigating the statistics of the strength of the signals in AERM PDs. Parameters Used for the Analysis: Beam Power = 275kW Beam radius = 6.2cm PD radius = 2.5mm (ref. G2200606-v1 ) Power in the PD = NumberOfCounts*(7.6e-8 W/cts) (ref. alog 66636 ) Laser Wavelenght = 1064nm Mirror transmissivity: 5ppm (ref.

Our observations so far indicate that the comb is only visible in Corner Station channels. Details: The following is a list of the observations we have made regarding this line: - We checked for the 11.11 Hz comb across all Monitor and Magnetometer channels listed in the Fscan configuration using daily (241120) and weekly (241113) plots. - The 11.11 Hz peak strong with high coherence is visible in all CS MAG channels particularly in LVEA_INPUTOPTICS and LVEA_OUTPUTOPTICS: - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_EBAY_SUSRACK_X_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_EBAY_SUSRACK_Y_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_EBAY_SUSRACK_Z_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_EBAY_ISCRACK_X_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_EBAY_ISCRACK_Y_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_EBAY_ISCRACK_Z_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_VERTEX_X_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_VERTEX_Y_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_VERTEX_Z_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_INPUTOPTICS_X_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_INPUTOPTICS_Y_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_INPUTOPTICS_Z_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_OUTPUTOPTICS_X_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_OUTPUTOPTICS_Y_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_OUTPUTOPTICS_Z_DQ: strong peak - The 22.22 Hz and 33.33 Hz peaks also appear in most CS MAG channels but lack coherence. - Among PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_VERTEX channels only the X channel exhibits high coherence. - The peaks are also prominent in L1_PEM-FCES_MAG_VEA_FLOOR X and Y channels but show no coherence with DARM. - High coherence for the 11.11 Hz peak is also seen in the following Monitor channels: - L1_OMC-PZT1_MON_AC_OUT_DQ (and not in PZT2) - L1_PEM-CS_AMON_BEAMTUBE_40X_DQ - L1_PEM-CS_AMON_BEAMTUBE_40Y_DQ - L1_PEM-CS_VMON_ITMX_ESDPOWER18_DQ (weak) - L1_PEM-CS_VMON_ITMY_ESDPOWER18_DQ (weak) - The peak is not observed in EX or EY channels. - The peak is not observed in MAINSMON channels. - Using Tsft = 900 s and 12h of data we have also checked the additional channels which are voltage monitors in the corner station. The following VMON channels exhibit the 11.11 Hz peak and show high coherence with DARM (L1:CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ): - L1_PEM-CS_ADC_4_15_OUT_DQ (VMON on orange power supply on PSL-R1 in LVEA) - L1_PEM-CS_ADC_4_16_OUT_DQ (VMON on 18V supply on ISC-C1) - L1_PEM-CS_ADC_4_17_OUT_DQ (VMON on 18V supply on ISC-C4) - L1_PEM-CS_ADC_4_18_OUT_DQ (VMON on 12V supply on ISC-C4) - L1_PEM-CS_ADC_4_27_OUT_DQ (VMON on 18V HAM16 SEI rack) - All additional VMON channels in the Corner Station except L1_PEM-CS_ADC_4_28_OUT_DQ (VMON on HAM23 SEI rack) exhibit the peak. It is most pronounced in L1_PEM-CS_ADC_4_27_OUT_DQ. However the 22.222 Hz and 33.333 Hz peaks are not visible in these channels. - We have also been moving additional channels L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_26_OUT_DQ and L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_19_OUT_DQ to monitor different power supplies in order to search for a possible source. - First change: - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_19_OUT_DQ (VMON on 18 V TCS AOS-C1): peak not found. - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_26_OUT_DQ (VMON on 24 V HAM16 SEI rack): peak found. - Second change: - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_19_OUT_DQ (VMON on 24 V HAM23 SEI rack): peak not found - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_26_OUT_DQ (VMON on lower 24 V HAM16 SEI rack): peak not found - Third change: - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_19_OUT_DQ (VMON on lower 24 V HAM23 SEI rack): peak not found - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_26_OUT_DQ (VMON 24 V HAM46 SEI rack): peak found - Fourth change: - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_19_OUT_DQ (VMON on 18 V HAM45 SEI rack): peak found - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_26_OUT_DQ (VMON on lower 24 V HAM45 SEI rack): peak not found - Fifth change: - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_19_OUT_DQ (VMON on 18 V BSC 1 SEI rack): peak found - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_26_OUT_DQ (VMON on 24 V BSC 1 SEI rack): peak not found - Sixth change: - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_19_OUT_DQ (VMON on 18 V BSC 2 SEI rack): peak found - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_26_OUT_DQ (VMON on lower 24 V BSC 1 SEI rack): peak not found Attaching to this alog some plots in order to illustrate the investigation and how the peak appears in some channels. - A diagram of the VMON checks done in the electronics room searching for the comb. - AMPPSD and Coherence plots of L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_INPUTOPTICS_Y_DQ (6.1 pT factor per ADC count above 10 Hz) showing the strong peak with week of data with Tsft 900s. - AMPPSD plot of L1_PEM-CS_ADC_4_27_OUT_DQ (VMON on 18V HAM16 SEI rack) showing the peak in 12h of data with Tsft 900s. - AMPPSD and Coherence plots of L1_OMC-PZT1_MON_AC_OUT_DQ with one day of data and Tsft 900s also showing the peak.

I suspect the culprit for the sqz degradation here is the phase noise so I decided to reduce our nlg temporarily by reducing opo green trans target value from 0.14 mW to 0.12 mW. Based on the recent nlg measurement this should correspond to an nlg decrease from 19.32 to 12.3. Attached is a squeezing vs nlg plot for 23% loss and 10:5:45 mrad phase noise (based on the most recent quantum noise budget in alog 73225 our losses were ~23% and phase noise 10-15 mrad). I assumed the losses are about the same since the high frequency squeezing we usually have is about the same as the time of the quantum noise budget measurements. The curves are calculated the same way as 72135 using the following formulas [E. Oelker et al. Optica 3 682-685 (2016)] and the code is attached .

All three nlg formulas using the unique combinations of size 2 of amplified deamplified and unamplified seed powers: nlg_ad = ((1 + sqrt(amplified/deamplified))/2) ^ 2 nlg_au = amplified/unamplified nlg_ud = (2 - sqrt(unamplified/deamplified)) ^ -2 Nonlinear interaction length is defined as x = 1 - 1 / sqrt(NLG) = sqrt (P/P_th) and from this calculation we find the P_th to be 0.235 mW.

To start I attempted to touch up alignment into the PMC remotely using the picomotors right before it with the ISS off but I wasn't able to get much of any improvement so I turned the ISS back on and made my way out to the enclosure. Once there I started with a power budget of the FSS path using the 3W-capable Ophir stick head: FSS In: 280.4 mW AOM In: 274.0 mW AOM Out (single-pass): 180.3 mW SP Diffraction Efficiency: 65.8% AOM Out (double-pass): 130.2 mW DP Diffraction Efficiency: 72.2% EOM Out: 129.2 mW The largest (and least surprising) area of power loss I noticed was in the AOM diffraction efficiencies so I started there. I adjusted the AOM stage itself mostly in pitch to improve the single-pass and M21 to improve the double-pass. I also checked that the beam was passing nicely through the FSS EOM (it was no adjustment needed here). The final power budget: FSS In: 280.4 mW AOM In: 274.0 mW AOM Out (single-pass): 195.9 mW SP Diffraction Efficiency: 71.4% AOM Out (double-pass): 139.5 mW DP Diffraction Efficiency: 71.2% EOM Out: 138.6 mW Having made good improvements I proceeded to adjust M23 and M47 the picomotor-controlled mirrors before the RefCav to align the beam back onto the alignment iris at the input of the RefCav. That done I then instructed the FSS autolocker to lock the RefCav. As seen before and noted most explicitly in alog81780 the autolocker could briefly grab the TEM00 mode but then lose it. I lowered the autolocker's State 2 delay (which determines how long to wait before turning on the temperature control loop after finding resonance) from 1.0 seconds to 0.5 and the autolocker was immediately successful. I've accepted this shorter delay time in SDF screenshot attached. The TPD was reporting a signal of 0.515 V with the RefCav locked so I used the pictomotors to improve alignment finishing with a TPD signal of 0.830 V . Seeing the beam spot on the RefCav REFL camera was now more than half out of view I rotated the camera in its mount slightly to center the image. I then unlocked the FSS and used M25 to tweak up the alignment onto the RFPD improving the voltage when using a multimeter from 0.370 V to 1.139 V then locked the FSS again to get an RFPD voltage of 0.213 V. This gives a visibility of the RefCav of 81.3% . I wrapped up in the enclosure turned the environmental controls back to science mode and returned to the control room. After about an hour while maintenance activities were finishing I turned the ISS back on currently diffracting around 3.3%.

When TJ and I were testing out the code for the function that generates the INCREASE/DECREASE BIAS states for SUS_PI we had decided on leaving the line in that sets the bias ramp time to 30 for going from a bias offset of -9 back to the nominal bias of -4.9. We thought it would be fine because the ramp time would get reverted when we lost lock but we forgot about the part where we have to go back into Observing after the PI gets damped at the higher bias (oops). At least it was me who had to intervene so I can suffer the consequences of my mistakes! I changed that line in the code( attachment ) so that when we are going from the higher bias to the nominal lower bias the ramp time is the nominal 120 seconds.

18946,H1 ISC - Calibrated Angle to Length Coupling from HARD loops,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81917,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 19 Dec 2024 17:36:08 -0800","This alog follows up LHO:81769 where I calibrated the ASC drives to test mass motion for all eight arm ASC control loops. Now I have taken the noise budget injections that we run to measure the ASC coupling to DARM and used that to calibrate an angle-to-length coupling function in mm/rad. I have only done this for the HARD loops because the SOFT loops do not couple very strongly to DARM (notable exception to CSOFT P which I will follow up on). The noise budget code uses an excess power projection to DARM but instead I chose to measure the linear transfer function. The coherence is just ok so I think a good follow up is to remeasure the coupling again and drive a bit harder/average longer (these are 60 second measurements). This plot shows the noise budget injection into calibrated DARM/ASC PUM drive [m/Nm] transfer function and the coherence of the measurement. I followed a similar calibration procedure to my previous alog: Go from ""H1:ASC-[DOF]_[P/Y]_OUT_DQ"" to Nm of PUM torque using G1100968 I made sure that I corrected by an erroneous factor of two that I found previously Some of these injections were done after the ETMX DAC change. However Daniel noted this alog for me 80023 so the calibration for the ASC should not change significantly. transform this N*m PUM drive to radians of test mass motion using the PUM-TST state space suspension model transfer function which is calibrated into real units (radian/Nm) I did all of this in python so I used Kevin's exported quad state space model found here: T2300299 I used the damped model which applies the ETMX top mass damping filters Multiply by 1e3 to convert to mm/rad I did not apply the drive matrix here so the calibration is into ETM motion only (factor of +/-1) whereas the calibration into ITM motion would have an additional +/- 0.74 (+/- 0.72 for yaw) applied. HARD Pitch Angle to Length coupling plot HARD Yaw Angle to Length coupling plot Overall the best-measured DOF here is CHARD Y. In both CHARD Y and DHARD Y there seem to be two clear coupling regions: one fairly flat region above 20 Hz in CHARD Y and above 30 Hz in DHARD Y reaching between 20-30 mm/rad. Below there is a steep coupling. This is reminiscient of the coupling that Gabriele Louis and I measured back in March and tried to mitigate with A2L and WFS offset. We found that we could reduce the flatter coupling in DHARD Y by adjusting the A2L gain and the steeper coupling by applying a small offset in AS WFS A yaw DC. We are currently not running with that WFS offset. The yaw coupling suggests that we have some sort of miscentering on both the REFL and AS WFS which causes a steep low frequency coupling which is less sensitive to beam centering on the test mass (as shown by the A2L tests) meanwhile the flat coupling is sensitive to beam miscentering on the test mass which is expected (see e.g. T0900511 ). The pitch coupling has the worst coherence here but the coupling is certainly not flat. It appears to be rising with about f^4 at high frequency. I have a hard time understanding what could cause that. There is also possibly a similar steep coupling at low frequency like the yaw coupling but the coherence is so poor it's hard to see. Assuming that I have my calibration factors correct here (please don't assume this! check my work!) this suggests that the beam miscentering is higher than 1 mm everywhere and possibly up to 30 mm on the ETMs (remember this would be ~25% lower on the ITMs). This seems very large so I'm hoping that there is another errant factor of two or something somewhere.

18955,H1 GRD - SUS_PI guardian now increases ETMY ESD bias to help damp PI24,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81909,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:51:04 -0800",Since we've been having issues with PI24 ringing up lately we decided to change the SUS_PI guardian code to increase the bias offset on ETMY L3 LOCK. That bias offset value is normally -4.9 and we noticed that when damping PI24 we typically start hitting our damping limit when PI24 RMSMON exceeds a value of 10. I have turned the PI_DAMPING state into a generator function so it can now make two different states PI_DAMPING and EXTREME_PI_DAMPING. When in PI_DAMPING pi24 will be damped with our normal bias until we reach an RMSMON average value of 20. Once that happens the guardian will jump to a state called INCREASE_BIAS (what it does is self-explanatory) and then goes into XTREME_PI_DAMPING where it continues damping and changing phase as needed until we are back under an RMSMON value of 4( pi24 script logic ). Once we are good the guardian will take us through DECREASE_BIAS (guess what that does) and then back into PI_DAMPING( node graph states list ). Because the nominal state for Observing is PI_DAMPING when we move into one of these other states we will be taken out of Observing ( tagging OPS ). Once we are back in PI_DAMPING we will automatically go back into Observing as long as we are in AUTOMATIC. Occasionally we do get small quick ringups that go up above 20 that are capable of being damped by regular damping and just changing the phase - ndscope1 (versus the slower ringups that cannot - ndscope2 ) so with these script changes when these happen we will be taken out of Observing as the SUS_PI guardian jumps to up the bias and damp harder. These don't happen very often so we are okay for now but a future to-do is to edit the script to keep it from increasing the bias at least until it's tried all phase changes.

Today I re-ran the sqz/h1/scripts/SCAN_PSAMS.py script with SQZ_MANAGER guardian paused (so it's not forcing the ADF servo on). The script worked as expected (setup by turning off ADF servo and increasing SQZ ASC gain to speed up then changed ZM PSAMS waited 120s for ASC to coverage turned off ASC scanned sqz angle and saved data and then repeated) and took ~3m30 per step. The results are attached ( heatmap scans ) but didn't show an obvious direction to move in. Maybe the steps were too small but are already larger than those use at LLO LLO#72749 : 0.3V vs 0.1V per step. Our initial ZM4/5 PSAMs values were 5.6V -1.1V and looking at the attached data we took them to 5.2V -1.5V. We then decided ther range looked better when the PSAMs were higher to went to 6.0V -0.4Vthis seemed to gain improve the range ~5MPc we checked by going back to 5.2V -1.5V and the range again dropped main change appears to be in orange BAND_2 OMC BLRMs which is 20-34Hz the places with glitches in OAF BLRMS are noisy times from Robert's injections. Then went further in this direction to 6.5V 0.0V this didn't help the range so we are staying at 6.0V -0.4V sdf's attached. This seemed to be a repeat-able change that gave us a few MPc's in range!

It appears that measurement is limited to dark noise of the diode above 40Hz. The ITMX_CO2_ISS_IN_AC channel dark noise is actually above the level when the laser is on this doesn't make sense to me. Is there anything strange happening in models or chassis? No. The filters in the DC _OUT channels include a CountstoVolts gain(0.000610352) and UndoGain gain(0.00196078) which is 1/510 from the PD electronics D1201111 as expected The AC _OUT channel includes a CountstoVolts gain(0.000610352) and de-whiten zpk([20] [0.01] 0.011322 ""n""). There is nothing else in the h1hsccs model. Looking at the TCS block diagram E1100892 the ISS PD outputs go though the TCS ISS and Interface Chassis D1300649 ( D1300015 shows there nothing happening to the signals inside this chassis) before going to the ADC. So the model should see the signals as if they were coming straight from the PD DB9 output + counts to volts gain. Does DC value of 7e-3 V make sense? Yes. In CIT#389 saw saw -1V (DCMON so gain of 255) for 60mW of laser power (can jump ~by a factor of 2 dependent on wavelength/polarization/how the laser is feeling). From this expect 1mV from diode (before electronics gain) is 15mW of laser power. So that the DC value measured of 7e-3 V would be around 100mW of power on the PD (within a factor of 2 is 50mW to 200mW). This makes sense as we would expect around 250mW on the ISS PD (50W out of laser x 99/1 BS x 50/50 BS). Does Dark noise value make sense: Unsure. In CIT#541 Gabriele shows DC dark noise values of 4e-7 /rHz this is straight out of the diode (DCMON so x gain of 255) so the comparable value to our _OUT channels would be 1.5e-9 /rHz. This is a factor of 3 different from the 5e-9/rHz dark value we measure at LHO on the DC OUT. Debatable math: The power noise of the diode is 1e-8 W/rHz (from Keita's computations attached to CIT#549 ). So the RIN should be noise-limited to 1e-8 W/rHz / 0.250W = 4e-8 /rHz. We are measuring down to 5e-9/rHz on the DC channel which is a factor of 10 lower than expected possible ","{'term': 'H1 TCS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81868,camilla.compton@ligo.org

Because of the way LHO changed their readouts for the OMC digging into the simulink model will reveal the PI is reading in only the first 32kHz band for the RMS calculations You simply have no aliasing down of the full band to utilise it in the way we do and it will never see 80kHz PI.

They have moved so that the central frequency is the same as the spikes around 10.4kHz this excites the PI's more. In the first plot we see that since November and the start of December the center of the lower HOM peak has drifted down in frequency to be underneath the 10.kHz PI modes : compare black (now) to red and brown. I tried to check more times to see exactly when this change happened in the 4th attached plot but this is tricky as the location and shape of the HOM depends on how warm the IFO is (i.e. was it DOWN a logn time before locking as in ref 7: Cold IFO). It sees like the change started 6th/7th Dec and was done by 10th Dec. In the second plot we see what happened in September when we increased the ETMY Ring Heater (as we repeated today 81891 ) both HOM peaks moved up in frequency which is the direction we want. Maybe an unrelated point is that since the start of October the circulating arm power has drifted down ~4kW (~1%) from 389 to 285kW when thermalized plot attached. It's hard to know what's caused this the IM4 TRANS drifted ~2% but was misaligned so would see alignment shifts 81735 the POP also drifted ~1% before it was recentered 81329 .

I examined drive strength during the 10kHz PI damping demonstration of the PSL ISS injection path from March [ aLog 70464 ]. Here is an ndscope showing that during the PI damping we were injecting about +/- 40 counts and the AOM drive readback is not really seeing any input. The readback displayed actually has a 500Hz LP but the signal is also invisible in the INMON. Notably during this particular PI we came quite close to lockloss because it took us quite a while to figure out the correct damping settings so you can consider this close to the extreme maximum required driving range. I set about calibrating counts out of the PSL-ISS_TRANSFER2_INJ output to the voltage sent to the AOM from the ""To AOM"" output of [ D1001985 ]. With the help of Josh in EE I measured the response of that box with GAIN inputs as they are in the front end right now. The other notable piece of electronics in the path is the AI chassis [ D070081 ] I effectively modelled as a 3rd order 10kHz Butterworth LP which you might imagine might cause issues for 80kHz injections. There are past injections done through PSL-ISS_TRANSFER2_INJ with as much as 100k counts which I used to peg my overall DC gain with for any components in the path that might be adding gain since 100k counts was roughly visible as 0.01V on the AOM drive. Here is the TF between 5kHz and 100kHz which encompasses D1001985 and D070081 and gain pegged to the aforemented rough readback response. The 40 counts needed to damp the 10kHz PI would have used no more than 1e-6 V of the AOM and indeed would not be readily visible in the AOM readback. There is also the response of the IMC [ aLog 8196 ] which projects the drive at 80kHz will see about 10x suppression relative to the 10kHz injection for real input into the IFO. Therefore to inject the same signal strength out to 80kHz with current AI chassis we'd need to drive 1e-5 V at the AOM and be driving +/-40k counts at the DAC (which I presume is 16bit with a max of +/-131k counts out) which I declare as feasible without even altering the AI chassis. The alterations needed are: the l1psl0 machine will need Dolphin inputs from l1susprocpi and the ideally PSL ISS model will need to run at 65kHz (currently runs 32kHz) to reduce the number of times the signal will need to be imaged up.

During this time the POP9I -> SRCL matrix element was changed from 4 to 1 to minimize the signal. Following the adjustment the PRCL noise coupling seemed to increased in the [20 40] Hz band while decreasing below it. Conversely the DARM response increased below 20 Hz. 10-20 Hz Band Injections: To investigate the increased DARM response PRCL/MICH/SRCL injections were performed in the [10 20] Hz band. The LSC noise couplings showed that PRCL is the dominate signal at lower frequencies SRCL at higher and MICH in-between.

Specifically we aligned the cross marks on the holes in the blade adjuster baseplate with the cross marks on the surface of the top plate. We also ensured the proper alignment of the blades within the blade guard adjuster assemblies. This process included the installation of the blade wire clamp and the blade wire jaw onto the HDS blades. The blades were paired based on the deflection measurement results obtained at LLO . These results can be found in the HDS Blade Deflection Measurements spreadsheet which also details the assignment of each blade to its corresponding suspension. As previously mentioned in alog 73497 the magnet/flag assemblies still need to be installed in the intermediate mass assembly D2000176-v5 . We have most of the parts for the magnet/flag assemblies cleaned and ready in the lab.

Fil just finished the work reconnecting the ITM ESDs and connected the HAM6 high voltage relays to the BSC3 interlocks(something like that - see attached ). After he did this we tested out the port protection but it failed due to the fast shutter not being open. It seems like the fast shutter usually reopens when we are going through PRMI/MICH states so that might have been why it was still closed from our last lockloss but it doesn't completely make sense because earlier before Corey ran the test the shutter had opened on its own while we sat in IDLE. I opened the shutter medm and manually opened the shutter and reran the test. It failed again and said it was due to the fast shutter not being able to reopen even though it had correctly closed and reopened it. I toggled the shutter closed and back open and this time the test ran and came back with OK so it seems like we are good to go to high power. Jenne called and had me check that we had ESD outputs on ITMX which we did so it looks like everything is good to go. When at CHECK_AS_SHUTTERS we did have the LOCKLOSS_SHUTTTER_CHECK alert that we needed to manually check the shutter so I ran the test script on the AS port protection screen again just to make sure and then INIT'ed that guardian.

Fil came in to take the BSC3 vacuum gauge to take the FAILED HAM6 vacuum gauge's place for the HAM6 interlock. This would pull the BSC3 gauge from the interlock it was used for: ITM ESDs---it was thought the ITM ESDs were NOT used. Returned to locking but then it was later brought up that the ITM ESD interlock is indeed needed for TRANSITION FROM ETMX. So we were on hold again. Ultimately it was decided to use the BSC3 vacuum gauge for BOTH the (1) HAM6 & (2) BSC3's ITMx ESD interlocks . Fil came in (2nd time driving out to the site today!) to make this change in the afternoon. The hope is we are now back to a the state before the HAM6 gauge/interlock crashed last night and Oli can return with locking. Winds are lower than yesterday BUT microseism is still high.

We are trying to instead use ETMY. Sheila had started work on modifying our usual guardian states to allow us to use the L3 on ETMY. That was in progress when we decided to try the prewritten (but not tested in while) 'lownoise esd etmy' states. We tried using the 'lownoise esd etmy' state but lost lock when it was doing the L3 Lock L 5 second ramp over to using ETMY. Yesterday's lockloss (at least the one around 27 Dec 2024 02:03:00 UTC) was as Corey said successful getting off of ETMX and then failed at swapping back to the low voltage version of ETMX. Today's lockloss had a ringup of about 161 Hz. Richard called to check in and said that it shouldn't be too hard to tee off (or something) that interlock cable so that it can be used for both ITM ESDs and also the HAM6 high voltages. Richard is planning to talk to Fil about the feasibility of this. Since our current plan is to see if we can go back to our nominal locking sequence I have copied over Sheila's temporary guardian changes (attached here also) and done an SVN revert to the version of ISC_LOCK.py that RyanS had checked in just before the winter holidays. The only diffs between that version and the version in the userapps directory were related to today's temporary changes. Corey has reloaded the guardian. Richard checked with Fil and Fil is on the way to make the change so we can go back to using our usual locking sequence.

Gerardo went out to check to see if it was dead. He phoned Fil and they did a power cycle of the gauge to see if this would improve the situation but it did not. After this H1 was taken to IDLE for the night (OWL shift cancelled). (Should have taken Observatory Mode to CORRECTIVE MAINTENANCE at this point but only remembered to do this this morning.) Work Permit 12260 generated. Fil arrived on-site around 9amPT (17utc). This Morning's Summary of Fil's Work : The HAM6 Interlock (for operations of the Fast Shutter + PZT) is now Using the BSC3 Interlock (or VAC gauge from BSC3 since it was decided to BYPASS the HAM6 VAC gauge which failed last night [alog 82005 ]). This means that the BSC3 Interlock is no longer being used for the ITM ESDs (which sounds like it's fine because Jenne/Fil said we don't use the ESDs for the ITMs). Fil noted that he confirmed that the Fast Shutter Chassis in the LVEA is OPERATIONAL. Fil then left the site after giving me this summary. As far as a test of this new HAM6 Interlock configuration I intentionally ran a test of the AS Port Protection system (sitemap/SYS/ AS Port Protection....this was my first time doing this). After clicking the RUN (test) button after a few seconds received an ""OK"" for the (1) Test & (2) Fault. After this test and the signed-off Work Permit we are OK to GO for High Power locking .

ISC_library.intrix.load() Commenting Out Line 2670 from ISC_Lock allowed me to stay locked in CARM_TO_REFL seems stable. For some reason loading this matrix seems to be unlocking the IFO. After that test that seemed to confirm my suspicion that loading the matrix unlocks the IFO. I had to unlock H1 and try again.... undo my changes.

Modes 3 and 6 are not turned on by the Guardian so were not rung up. I logged in from home and damped those modes. The default settings worked for modes 3 and 6. For mode 5 I used FM6 and FM10 and positive gain (2) and that was able to damp the mode. Mode 4 was more difficult to find after a lot of trials I found that FM1 FM4 and FM10 with positive gain (3) damped the mode slowly.While damping I edited the 1st order violin mode Guardian settings file so that none of the ITMY damping turns on automatically but since the IFO was already in OBSERVE I was not able to load the file. So the next time the IFO goes down please press the load button on the 1st order violin mode Guardian screen.Once the ITMY modes were damped I turned all ITMY damping off and I set the filters for each mode back to default. These modes are funny during cold weather and should not be left unattended they can shift phase and ring up very quickly. So to be safe if they are damped it is probably best to turn them off.SUS,"{'term': 'LLO OpsInfo', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",74609,marc.lormand@ligo.org
19149,H1 ISC - ETM glitch locklosses probably can't be fixed by adding ESD low pass,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=82103,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Fri, 03 Jan 2025 16:37:52 -0800",I have been trying to see if ETM glitches can be reduced by increasing the ~1khz roll off of the ESD but it seems like this is no the route. I wasn't able to find a filter that would reduce the amplitude of some typical glitches and not adversely affect the phase of DARM at the UGF. The idea was to add a low pass at the output of the L3 drive but it doesn't seem like this will work. I got 3 seconds of ESD drive data for one of the locklosses which had several glitches shortly before the lockloss. I then looked at how the time series for those ESD glitches changed when I added various lowpasses using lsim in matlab. First attached bode plot shows 2 filters red trace (filter2) is a way too aggressive filter blue (filter1) is something that would probably allow DARM to stay stable but only maybe help a little. Second plot is a timeseries showing the effects of the 2 filters on one of the glitches in the data I looked at. Yellow is the drive sent to one of the esd quadrants red is the glitch after applying the unstable filter2 from the first plot blue is with the less aggressive filter1. Even with the unstable filter the magnitude of the glitch isn't really reduced a ton. The phase margin at ~80hz for DARM is about 30 deg the blue filter reduces this by about 6 degrees. Sheila and I have talked about other approaches to make the IFO more robust to these glitches we'll take a look at that next week. ,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",82103,jim.warner@ligo.org

The main message is that we have a decent model of the quantum noise from October (see this and this plot ) can get a fairly independent constraint on homodyne angle and SRC detunings from these squeezer data sets without the filter cavity and some loose estimates for arm power based on squeezer losses. There is a discrepancy between the model and the data in the traces taken near anti-squeezing without the filter cavity that is interesting and I haven't tried to model mode mismatches yet. Outline of how this model is made: start with an assumption about arm power (365kW). Later we can check how this model changes with arm power changed. use noise budget estimate of technical noise at 1-2 kHz measured ASD and assumption about arm power to fit IFO readout efficenecy (82% here compare to known readout losses from google sheet ((1-0.005)*(1-0.00072)*(1-0.015)*(1-0.0096)*(1-0.036)*(1-0.02)= 91.6% expected from OFI 1 pass OM1 OM3 OMC QPD pick off OMC throughput DCPD QE). This implies 10.4% unknown readout losses including IFO to OMC mode mismatch but this depends on the arm power we start with. use the best sqz and anti-sqz (either with or without filter cavity) subtracting noise budget estimate of technical noise at kHz to estimate total squeezer efficiency (72%) and nonlinear gain (14.8). Set the squeezer injection losses so that the total squeezer efficiency is injection losses * IFO readout losses. This gives us 12.1% injection losses compared to 8.2% known injection losses from the google sheet (1-0.015)*(1-0.01)**3*(1-0.01)*(1-0.01)*(1-0.01)*(1-0.01) for OPO 3 SFI passes FC WFS pick off ZMs OFI sqz injection and SRC losses) this gives us 4.25% unknown injection losses . A mode mismatch could cause a different readout loss for the IFO beam than for the squeezer so this assingment of losses could be incorrect if there is a large mode mismatch between the IFO and the OMC. The code fits the squeezing angle for anti-squeezing and squeezing traces to either maximize or minimize quantum noise. For the other squeezing angles (mid squeezing +/-10 from sqz or a sqz) it uses a fit. This fit starts with an estimate of the non-quantum noise made by subtracting the measure DARM asd without squeezing from the quantum noise model without squeezing from 2055 Hz to 2300Hz and adds that to a quantum noise model to fit the squeezing angle. The procedure up to this point should force all the models to match the measurements at 2kHz but not at mid or low frequencies. The first two attachments show data from mid October ( 80664 ) separated into two different plots (one with mid squeezing one with +/-10 degrees from sqz and a sqz) to make it easier to read. We can look at the mid and low frequencies to help us constrain the model for homodyne angle SRC detuning and maybe mode matching and FC parameters. With the filter cavity the traces that are +/- 10 degrees from squeezing and anti-squeezing don't provide much information we can probably skip these in future data sets but the ones +/-10 degrees from anti-squeezing without the filter cavity are interesting. Arm power: We can get some constraints on arm power by assuming that all of our unknown loss is injection loss or all readout loss this gives us a range of 327kW-381kW with a homodyne angle of 10.8 degrees and no SRC detuning. Attached are plots made for the high and lower power models by clicking back and forth you can see that the lowest powers seem to disagree with the low frequency data implying that some of our unknown losses truly are readout losses but this isn't a very precise way to estimate arm power. SRC detuning: Without the filter cavity the mid squeezing traces are most clearly sensitive to SRC detuning shown in this attachment where the SRC detuning of 0.057 degrees is clearly too large. You can flip through these 5 SRC plots which suggests that our SRC detuning at the time of these measurements was between 0 and -0.057 degrees (I'll leave it at -0.029 degrees or -1mrad in the model) . Homodyne angle: In 80747 we noticed that anti-squeezing without the filter cavity is very sensitive to the homodyne angle and that we've been using the wrong sign for our modeling in O4. Here are plots that reaffirm that the negative homodyne angle is wrong with mid squeezing (as we did in 80747) and with squeezing angle +/-10degrees from squeezing and anti-squeezing which also clearly shows the problem for those traces near anti-squeezing. It's also nice to notice that the mid sqz traces aren't especially sensitive to homodyne angle in the mid frequency range taht we were using to set the SRC detuning so this data set without the filter cavity can give us fairly independent constraints on SRC detuning and homodyne angle. Here is a plot of the homodyne angle of 10.7 degrees (based on 71913 ) without the squeezing traces so that it's easier to see what's happening. There is a large discrepancy between the model and FDAS -10 degrees from 30-55Hz and there is also a smaller discrepancy for FDAS+10 degrees in this frequency range. This discrepancy can be redcued a bit by making the homodyne angle larger but that doesn't seem to be a good model of the data so this discrepancy is probably due to something we aren't modeling correctly here. Filter cavity detuning: We have used -33Hz as the filter cavity detuning but data from mid squeezing with the filter cavity suggests that the detuning in this data set closer to 27 Hz. Here is a series of plots to show how mid sqz is sensitive to FC detuning. The last two plots are with the final model paramters it is a reasonably good description of the data with the main discrepancy remaining in the anti-squeezing without the filter cavity. The scripts parameters and data used to make these plots is in quantumnoisebudgeting commit 92f7e965. The quantum noise paramters used are here.

Today the SHG output was particular low so I adjusted the input pointing as well as lowered the temperature to 35.0C (from 35.5C). This gave us about 10% more green power but still not enough! I then further increased the green power by adjusting the waveplate in front of the cube. The rejected power (H1:SQZ-SHG_REJECTED_DC_POWERMON) is currently showing 1.8mW down from around 4.7mW when I started. There is a little bit further to go but we may have to realigning the green fiber coupler on the table.

Since we were out of Observing (and I had already gotten a workspace ready to work on the Squeezer) I wanted to try a ""simple"" Squeezer check (basically what Oli did with taking the Manager to DOWN and going back to FDS. I thought I was close to FDS because all of the sub-nodes went to NOMINAL states and then I believe the Manager would get to FDS but then go to NO SQUEEZING.....Then I realized all their NOMINAL states were set for NO SQUEEZING! So I worked on transitioning all 8-nodes Nominal states for SQUEEZING to work on squeezing but the issue I ran into was that the OPO_LR node had trouble getting to LOCKED_CLF_DUAL due to "" USERMSG 0: No pump ISS means injecting bad squeezing. Going DOWN. "" --->This sounds like yet another different SQZ issue. I did not have issues with the SQZ_FC as far as I could tell (also did not get to see the ""leap second"" issue RyanC noted last night). At this point I was stumped but got a mattermost from Sheila saying she could help in a bit. So I switched all SQZ node Nominal states for NO Squeezing to get more Observing in the mean time. SIDE NOTE: The buisiness for transitioning SQZ Nominal States is not quick or trivial (atleast for my slow self). While transitioning nodes for Observing WITH Squeezing I ran into a LOADING error for the OPO_LR node. Eventually found that it was a typo in the wiki (for editing all the nodes I copied the state from the wiki into the node python files. I discovered the wiki had a typo [or the state had a slightly different name int he past]. For OPO_LR the wiki said to make the Nominal -> ""LOCK_CLF_DUAL"". Eventually figured out from the log that this name was wrong it is ""LOCKED_CLS_DUAL"". At any rate I updated wiki.

After a couple minutes could see that the MANAGER & LO_LR nodes were cycling and not getting anywhere. Wiki First At this point I opened the Troubleshooting SQZ wiki's ""Can't Get To FREQ_DEP_SQZ"" section . From this I took MANAGER to NO SQUEEZING and then opened up all the SQZ Nodes. At this point I notice the OPO_LR node which had been green is actually also cycling (but not as fast as the MANAGER & LO_LR. And OPO_LR was also showing a User Message BUT it displayed too quick that I had to take a screenshot really quick to catch it. This node would hang out at the NOMINAL state (LOCKED CLF DUAL) drop out from this display a message(s) for 1sec and then return to nominal state....all within a minute or so. There were actually 2 messages they were to the best I could see (also attached): pump fiber rej power in ham7 high nominal 35e-3 align fiber pol on sqzt0 Disabling pump iss after 10 lockloss counter. Going to through LOCKED CLF_DUAL_NO_ISS to turn on agai At this point I started diving into medms for anything related to the shy messages above. ""pump fiber rej power"" gave me the most info for where to look but at this point I also wanted to do an alog search. Then Alog Search I searched OPO_LR where I focused on an alog from (1) RyanS which referenced a Tony alog and (2) RyanC . These three alogs narrowed my focus and had me looking at: HAM7 Fiber Rejected Power signal SQZT0 waveplate The Rejected power has been trending for the last month+ up to a max value around 3.0 (where it starts from about 0.03). I wasn't totally sure I had the scenario right so at this point I reached out to Daniel (main contact for SQZ on the Call List). Phoning Daniel For Help After giving a summary the best I could Daniel logged in and started looking. Some of the main points he mentioned: Fiber polarization Did not have enough green power Running out of range Crystal may be degrading Need more Green power! With all that saidm he was able to get the LO_LR node to its nominal state but he mentioned we could also fix the Fiber Rejected Power (atleast until the new year or about a week!). So he started to work on this. And this ended up being what was done by RyanS in his alog. See attached for image showing which waveplate/picomotor he adjusted on SQZT0 along with the HAM7 Fiber Rejected Power signal he watched & reduced. See attached for zoom in of the rejected power signal adjusment he made.

Given that we see two different height shelves that might line up with different microseismic frequencies I also did a higher frequency line in all four ISIs and HEPIs. Huyen had gone around and injected 0.2 Hz on all ISIs so I did 0.32 Hz for the higher microseism peak we sometimes see.

We went only SQZT0 and Sheila adjusted the alignment into the OPO pump fiber with the OPO unlocked bringing the the OPO REFL DC power from 1.7 to 1.9mW.

Sheila and I have started looking at those again post-OFI replacement. Just attaching the plot of power at the anti-symmetric port (ie. into HAM 6) vs. power after the OMC as measured by the DCPDs. The plot is found in /ligo/gitcommon/labutils/darm_offset_step/figures/ and is also on the last page of the pdf Elenna linked above. From this plot we can see that the relationship between the power into HAM 6 (P_AS) is related to the power at the output DCPDs as follows. P_AS = 1.220*P_DCPD + 656.818 mW Where the second term is light that will be rejected by the OMC + that which gets through the OMC but is insensitive to DARM length changes. The throughput between the anti-symmetric port and the DCPDs is 1/1.22 = 0.820. So that means 18% of the TM00 light that we want at the DCPDs is lost through HAM 6.

For the most part we are hands off on the hardware of the Fiber Puller--the alignment should rarely need to be changed for many fiber pulls and there is definitely no need to touch any of the mechanics of the machine. Our main interface with the machine is to load in a Fiber Stock possibly make small adjustments of the upper translation stage and that's about it for the machine. The rest of the handling is via the Labview program laser controller and switches which are outside of the Fiber Puller enclosure. The RESET state issue is worth noting because there had been minimal changes to the system from the afternoon before. The switches which control positions of the upper & lower moving stages had not been touched. Fiber Puller eventually resulted in a correct RESET state but it was after several other ""dry"" pulls (and Labview restarts/checks). The CO2 lasers for the Fiber Puller have some variability in laser power (which we see by the camera videos) and this is normal. Yesterday was notable only because the laser power was very noticeably low. The previous 100W laser (which was a bit older...manufactured in 2010) started to have symptoms of low power in 2021-22 which ultimately led to us decommissioning it and swapping it for the newer 200W laser (manufactured in 2018). Only noting the low-power observation as a data point for possible early end of life symptoms for it. ","{'term': 'X1 SUS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",82200,corey.gray@ligo.org

The CONTROLMON was at the bottom of it's range trying to inject this level of light hence the OPO locking issues plot. In the past we've got back to Observing by following 70050 and lowering the OPO trans set point. But as we haven't maxed out the amount of power in the SHG to OPO path yet we tuned this up with H1:SYS-MOTION_C_PICO_I motor 2 instead. A temporary fix if OPO is having issues and the H1:SQZ-OPO_ISS_CONTROLMON is too low can still be following 70050 . It's surprising that the amount of pump light has increased this quickly and quicker than after the last spot move plot but our OPO refl is still low compared to before meaning that the new crystal spot still has lower losses than the last. We might need to realigned the SHG pump fiber to increase the amount of light we can inject. We can work on improving Guardian log messages. ,"{'term': 'LHO General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",82196,camilla.compton@ligo.org

19297,X1 SUS - Possible Laser Oddities for the LIGO SUS Fiber Puller,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=82189,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 16:21:05 -0800","For reference here is a link with a summary of somewhat recent status for the LIGO SUS Fiber Puller: alog # 80406 Fiber pulling was on a bit of a hiatus with a busy Fall/Winter of Ops Shifts and travel. This week returned to the Fiber Puller lab to pull as many fibers as possible (have some free days this/next week). Thought I would note today's work because of some odd behavior. Yesterday ended up spending most of the time making new Fiber Stock (we were down to 2 and about 12 more were made). Also packaged up Fiber Cartridge hardware returned from LLO and stored here to get re-Class-B-ed. Ended the day yesterday (Jan7) pulling 2025's first fiber: S2500002 . This fiber was totally fine and no issues. Today I did some more lab clean-up but then around lunch I worked on pulling another fiber. Issue with RESET Position The first odd occurrence was with the Fiber Puller/Labview app. When I RESET the system to take a fresh new Fiber Stock the Fiber Puller/Labview moved the Upper & Lower Stages to a spot where the Upper Stage/Fiber Cartridge Bracket was too ""high"" wrt the Fixed Lower Bracket---so I was not able to install a new Fiber Stock. Closing the Labview App and a couple of ""dry pulls"" later I was FINALLY! able to get the system to the correct RESET position. (not sure what was the issue here!) Laser Power Looks Low Now that the Fiber Stock was set to be POLISHED & PULLED I worked on getting the Fiber Stock Aligned (this is a step unique to our set up here at LHO). As I put CO2 beam on the Fiber Stock the first thing I noticed was very dim light on the stock (as seen via both cameras of the Fiber Puller). This was at a laser power of 55.5% (of the 200W ""2018-new"" laser installed for the Fiber Puller last summer). The alignment should not have changed for the system. I wondered if there were issues with the laser settings. I notice I had the laser controller at the ""ANV"" setting---it should be ""MANUAL"". But nothing improved the laser power. Miraculously the laser power (as seen with the cameras) returned to what I saw yesterday for S2500002 so I figured it was a glitch and then moved on to a POLISH but within a few minutes and being mindful of the laser power on the stock on the cameras once again the laser spot became dim. But I did nothing and just let the POLISH finish (about 15min). Fearing there was power-related issue I decided to run the Pull (takes less than a minute) but at a higher power (75% vs 65% which had been the norm the last few months). S2500003 pulled fine and passed. I thought we were good but when I set up for S2500004 I noticed more low and variable laser power. I worked on this fiber later in the afternoon after lunch. This one started with power which looked good to me (qualitatively) so I continued with set-up. But in a case of déjà vu the laser power noticeably dipped in power as seen via the cameras. For this fiber I decided to continue but since S2500003 had a ""low-ish"" violin fundamental freq (~498Hz) I figured I would return to a power of 65% for the Pull (hoping the laser power was hot enough for the pull (and not cool enough to cause the fiber to break during the pull---something which happened with our old and dying 100W laser we replaced in 2024). Pulled the fiber and it all looked fine profiled the fiber and then ran an analysis on the fiber: it FAILED. This is fine. Fibers fail. Since Aug we have pulled 29 fibers and this was the 5th FAIL we have had. This is where I ended the day but I'm logging this work only for some early suspicions with the laser. Stay Tuned For More!

As per previous experiences I went all the way up to -10V (which is attenuated by 0.28/100 in the CM board) but could not get past the true maxima of the transmission (i.e. ""the other side of the slope""). Also the IN1 gain seemed to have an effect on the transmission when the offset was constant i.e. the higher the gain the smaller the transmission. We know that the error signal (in volts) is not drastically smaller at EY than EX.

I enabled the IN2 and made sure that OUT2 is connected to IN1 (1st attachment). With this setting H1:LSC-[XY]_EXTRA_AI_2/H1:ALS-[XY]_REFL_ERR_OUT_DQ is 40dB smaller than the OLTF see the circuit diagram of the CM board ( D040180 especially page 5) and an overview ( D1002416/005). It turns out that the PDH OLTF (2nd attachment note that there's a factor of 100 in the denominator so you have to add 40dB) is about 10dB smaller in ALSY with the nominal setting (red) than ALSX (black dashed) despite that H1:ALS-Y_REFL_LOCK_LOCKEDGAIN (6dB) is 2dB larger than H1:ALS-X_REFL_LOCK_LOCKEDGAIN (4dB). So there's a total of 12dB gain difference somewhere upstream of the common mode board. That shouldn't be such a big deal once it's locked but it could be problematic for acquisition as H1:ALS-Y_REFL_LOCK_ACQUIREGAIN was -20dB while H1:ALS-X_REFL_LOCK_ACQUIREGAIN was and is -6dB. In other words the electronics gain is 14dB smaller for Y than X and the sensing gain upstream of the common mode board is 12dB smaller for Y. It's 26dB difference in total. I wanted to adjust the demod phase in Y but was distracted by something else so I just increased the gain setting for Y: H1:ALS-Y_REFL_LOCK_ACQUIREGAIN is -12 (originally -20) H1:ALS-Y_REFL_LOCK_LOCKEDGAIN is 10 (was 6). For LOCKEDGAIN I tried 14dB and it started dropping lock for unknown reasons 12dB was OK (brown trace) but I just didn't want to get close to 14dB. I'm pretty sure ACQ gain could be increased further but -12dB is the gain I tested first and it locked quickly and I didn't have time.

Last done in 76040 . Want to get a homodyne measurement in our new OPO crystal spot location 82134 would plan to then repeat this a few months later to see any difference. Aligned the homodyne but ran out of time before taking any data. May try to repeat on Thursday during commissioning. Sheila offloaded the IFO ASC and edited the guardian code for clearing the ASC so that it now includes clearing the integrators that we moved into the ZMs. Turned up SEED injected power from 0.7mW to 72mW to match the power from the LO (0.544mW on HDA and B). We later turned the LO power down with the pico HWP to match the SEED power. Jennie adjusted the LO beam with SEED beam blocked to improve the subtraction: Checked we were centered on PDA/B using the steering mirrors downstream of the HD BS and then measured the HD DIFF spectrum. Adjusted BS re centered on HD PDs and re-checked if DIFF spectrum shot noise had improved. Sheila and Jennie aligned the SEED beam onto the LO beam. We expected to be able to see fringing on HD A/B at this point but couldn't tried adjusting the alignment with ZM4 didn't help. It turned out tat the fringing was there clear when using an oscilloscope just unclear on ndscope. Sheila further tuned the SEED alignment to minimize fringing. We measured peaks at 1.85V bottom of fringes at 29mV with 2mV dark noise giving visibility of 97.1% . Then went back to the control room and measured NLG like normal (OPO to LOCKED SEED NLG) NLG = 10.3 . Sheila turned down the SEED beam back to 0.7mW. Then could start to take HD SQZ measurements Using SQZ_MANAGER to SQZ READY HD (takes LO to LOCKED HD) and OPO to LOCKED_CLF_DUAL. We needed to increase SHG power from 10mW to ~16mW to allow 80uW on OPO Trans. Plot attached: Dark noise was the same as original plot LO shot noise (ref10) With NLG 10.3 ASQZ was 13.8dB (ref2) this seems similar to last measurements. We planned to take ASQZ/SQZ data at different NLG's however I was having some issues with the OPO GRD unlocking and ran out of time.

This state hadn't been edited since we moved the ASC integrators to the suspension lock filters so when Vicky and Oli tried it the ASC wasn't really reset making it more difficult to recover from that situation.

My thought was that the suspensions are moving too much to catch and then it would run through the DOWN state after failing to hold it moving the suspensions again. During initial alignment today this happened to me so I waited in down for a bit and then tried to lock. It locked straight away possibly confirming my suspicions. From this I bumped up a timer in Prep_For_SRY in the ALIGN_IFO node to allow SRM to settle a bit more before trying to acquire. Hopefully this will help with the SRY locking issues we've been having but I'll keep an eye on it.

KisselBack in July 2024 ( LHO:78956 LHO:78960 LHO:78975 ) I'd installed some infrastructure in the h1iopomc0 front-end model that picks off the 4x copies of the 2x OMC DCPDs directly at the ADC input sends them through a matrix H1:OMC-ADC_INMTRX_$m_$n and pipes the matrix output into test filter banks called H1:OMC-DCPD_A1 H1:OMC-DCPD_B1 H1:OMC-DCPD_A2 H1:OMC-DCPD_B2 As shown in the above mentioned aLOGs these pick-offs are completely independent of the interferometer the matrix output only goes to these four filter banks and the filtered output is terminated in the front-end code. As such there is no impact on the detector performance noise or calibration if and when the parameters of these pick-off paths are changed. However - a lot of the noise investigations we'd like to do with these paths are the most interesting while the detector is in nominal low noise the state we're in most often for observing - because this front-end is running at 524 kHz - storing these extra test-only filtered output channels to frames is too taxing on the data storage system and - even *looking* at more than 3 channels at a time live is taxing on the front-end's given 1/(2^19 [Hz]) = 1.9 [usec] clock cycle turn-around time.This makes the usual method of testing and changing parameters during an observing run -- ""just change something during a lock-loss during commissioning times or during maintenance then look at the data in the past"" -- intractable.So all this being said in order to increase the amount of live time we have to commission and iterate the tests done with this path I've unmonitored all the EPICs records associated with these pick offs' input matrix and filters. 52 channels total and the explicit list of unmonitored channels is attached as screenshots.Details:The h1iopomc0 model only has one SDF file in /opt/rtcds/userapps/release/cds/h1/burtfiles/h1iopomc0/ safe.snap The target area's safe and OBSERVE .snap files that the front-end uses are both soft links to this file /opt/rtcds/lho/h1/target/h1iopomc0/h1iopomc0epics/burt/ OBSERVE.snap -> /opt/rtcds/userapps/release/cds/h1/burtfiles/h1iopomc0/safe.snap safe.snap -> /opt/rtcds/userapps/release/cds/h1/burtfiles/h1iopomc0/safe.snap So.

I started to test things at 17:00 UTC but ran into a collision with Jim's measurements. During the first attempt I was able to determine that the shutter closing will cause the PCALX_STAT guardian to go to a FAULT [37] State after 60 Seconds. It then cycles between waiting [4] and Nominal_PCAL[10] and Fault mutiple times per second until the fault is resolved. I have remedied this issue. After Jim finished his work I was able to continue testing the guardian using a few other buttons. Potential PCAL Failure modes: Things I've tested: If the channel: H1:CAL-PCALX_OSC_SUM_ON gets turned off then the PCAL_STAT Gaurdian alarms because it is checking for this . This channel is also being monitored via SDF. H1:CAL-INJ_END_SW channel being switched from X to Y does not trigger a fault but this is being Monitored via SDF. H1:CAL-INJ_MASTER_SW channel is also monitored via SDF. OFS Loop Open check worked well by checking to see if this H1:CAL-PCALX_OPTICALFOLLOWERSERVOENABLE channel is set correctly and checking the H1:CAL-PCALX_OFS_PD_OUT16 voltage against a known threshold. Guardian worked well. TXPD H1:CAL-PCALX_TX_PD_WATTS_OUTMON and or RXPD H1:CAL-PCALX_RX_PD_WATTS_OUTMON could have some fault in their signals. the Guardian worked well for this as well. H1:CAL-PCALX_SWEPT_SINE_ON could be turned off. This channel is currently not being monitored. potential solution is to just monitor it via SDF.

19344,H1 ISC - Correcting cumulative range estimation,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81291,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Mon, 06 Jan 2025 16:16:53 -0800","D. Davis E. Capote O. Patane There was a discussion recently in the Detchar tools channel about how to interpret the cumulative range plots generated on the summary pages such as today's cumulative range plot . Specifically it seems incorrect that we could accumulate 30% of our range below 30 Hz. Derek has pointed out that this is so misleading because the calculation of cumulative range in this manner is actually performed somewhat incorrectly. In short range can be thought as analogous to SNR which is a quantity that must be added in quadrature. Therefore the order matters when calculating a cumulative range i.e. the range acquired from 10-20 Hz then 10-30 Hz 10-40 Hz etc. Therefore the total cumulative range number as in the one we think about all the time (160 Mpc for example) is correct but determining the range over a subset of the band (such as 10-30 Hz) needs to be done more carefully so it is not misleading. Once we started discussing this I pointed out that this means that the way we compare ranges is also misleading as in when we run our DARM integral comparison scripts we are subtracting the cumulative range of two different DARM PSDs but we subtract it in amplitude (Mpc) and not in quadrature (Mpc^2). Derek has created an improved way to calculate cumulative range which they have coined to be the ""cumulative normalized range"". To get right to the point: it is better to normalize the cumulative range squared by the total range. This is an example plot showing how these two differ. This plot shows that for a given DARM PSD the cumulative normalized range better estimates the sensitivity gained over a particular range of frequency. The low frequency portion is still very important (this results from the f^(-7/3) dependence in the range calculation) but indeed we gain very little sensitivity between 10-20 Hz for example. You can also see that when using the normalized method the curve where you integrate up in frequency and the curve where you integrate down in frequency intersect at about 50% of the range which is what you would expect. In equation form this image attachment defines the total cumulative range and this image attachment shows our defintion of the normalized cumulative range. In order to more sensibly compare two sensitivities by frequency we have also derived a way to calculate the cumulative normalized range difference. The derivation is slightly more complicated but the result is that you subtract the two cumulative normalized quantities and then normalize by the sum of the two ranges. This image attachment shows the equation form of this. To make sense of why this method is better than the method we use now you can imagine that we have two PSDs one with 100 Mpc of range and one that is exactly the same except that between 10-20 Hz there is an additional gain of 20 Mpc such that the total range is now 120 Mpc. If you compare these two bizarre PSDs you would expect that the cumulative range difference between the two from 10-20 Hz is 20 Mpc and then zero thereafter. This is an example plot showing how the cumulative range difference would appear using the method where you subtract the two cumulative ranges and then the method where you apply this normalized range method. The normalized range calculation behaves as expected while the method that straightforwardly subtracts the two cumulative ranges overshoots the range gain from 10-20 Hz and then misleadingly indicates the range is decreasing above 20 Hz to make up for it. There is a lot of information to grasp here and Derek and I will be posting a document to the DCC soon with a fuller explanation and full derivations. Oli has taken the time to implement these new methods in our DARM comparison scripts and they will follow up here with more information about that.

We wanted to go through and verify what the physical d4 value aka the physical location of the prism-clamp breakoff point is in our latest set of measurements we took at the end of October. We wanted to verify this just because when we were messing around with d4 back in early 2024 ( 75947 76071 ) we never checked any measurements where we changed around d4 with the stage2 parameter correctly on meaning that those d4 comparisons all plotted changes in the effective d's instead of the physical d's. I've plotted a few parameter sets where the stage2 parameter is on so we can more properly compare them. I've plotted: the current default parameter set which has d4 = FDR = 0.5mm as well as having d1 = FDR - 2.5mm this parameter set had been decided by us to be the new default a while ago variations on the FDR parameter set with d4 being the FDR d4 value shifted by +/- 0.5 1.0 or 1.5mm. For these parameter sets d1 is left as its original FDR value Our most recent measurements from October 31st which was after all the M1 blade heights had been changed Here are the plots . The zoomed L and P plots are the best for seeing the differences between the different parameters. The Oct31 measurement seems to match best somewhere between d4 - 1.0mm and d4 - 0.5mm so the value of d4 that we have in our current set seems to still match pretty well. It is interesting to see though the difference between the dark red and the yellow traces as compared to our latest measurement since the only difference between those two is the d1 value. It looks like somewhere along while messing with the blade heights we also moved away from the d1 = FDR - 2.5mm value and closer to the d1 value given in the FDR.

I ran all the injections with the calibration lines off. The pitch couplings now appear to be very flat which is what we expect. However they are very high (100 mm/rad !!) which seems nearly impossible. The yaw couplings still show a strong frequency dependence below 30 Hz and are flat above and around 30-50 mm/rad still large. Whether or not the overall beam miscentering value is correct this does indicate that there is some funny behavior in yaw only that causes two different alignment coupling responses. Since this is observed in both DHARD and CHARD it could be something common to both (so maybe less likely to be related to the DARM offset light on the AS WFS). I also ran a measurement of the CSOFT P coupling injection plot . I was only able to get good coherence up to 30 Hz but it seems to be fairly flat too CSOFT P coupling .

Last done in 80451 followed those instructions. Before translating the crystal we reduced the green H1:SQZ-SHG_LAUNCH_DC_POWERMON power from 30mW down to 6mW. After we finished we brought this up to 15mW and still could lock the OPO with 80uW on H1:SQZ-OPO_TRANS_LF_OUTPUT and around 6 on the ISS controlmon. Meaning our losses reduced significantly. We moved from the 3rd spot from the left photo to the 4th spot from the left photo ( 34 x steps of 50 to the right and then 19 x steps of 10 to the right). We have previously used the 2nd 3rd and 5th spots from the left there is 6 spots in total. Measured NLG to be 8.8 (0.0787/0.00892 76542 ). This is lower than what we usually run with 11 to 17 so means that this new spot has less losses but a worse NLG. FDS is the same but ASQZ lower.

An example of BNS range oscillations can be seen at the beginning of Jan 1 2025 ( link ). in this a-log we looked at the camera signals for the four test masses looking for any correlations. The attached plot shows the camera signals (minute-trend of mean) during a few hours on Jan 01 2025 along with BNS range. We see some movement of beams especially on ETMY (SUM). The ETMY SUM (and WX) show visible half-hourly oscillations similar to BNS range oscillations. But it shows oscillations even when there is no BNS range osscillations. So it is not clear whether there is any cause and effect scenario here. From the control persepective it is little interesting and maybe one can check whether we can reduce these beam movements. We looked at the camera signals before ( alog 73336 ) during another time when there were BNS range oscillations. In that a-log we looked the 16 Hz camera signals so they were a bit noisier. Here we look at the mean averaged over a minute which show some variations.

L1 remained in observing mode for the whole day of 12/30/2024 & 12/31/2024. Most of the lock losses were due to earthquakes and some due to L1 being in commissioning. Average BNS range remained between 160-170 Mpc with multiple days having dips due to microseism high winds and ground motion. Microseism remained high throughtout the week with some major EQs causing lock losses. Wind and ground motion also remained on the high causing noises in the PEMs. Corner and End BSCs contained low frequency high amplitude noise multiple days which could be correlated to environmental factors such as wind and ground motion (See DQ Shift Report for more details). L1:LSC-REFL_A_RF9_Q_ERR_DQ channel appeared in multiple HVETO summaries during the week. Some new channels appeared for multiple days while some channels repeated.

The transmitted power increased from 4.1 to 5.0. I'm hoping this helps improve the FSS locking time (see FRS ticket 32977 ). I also lowered the ISS diffracted power from just above 6% to just below 5%. We had increased this when we were having locklosses from ISS AOM saturations which were ultimately due to a sub-optimal PMC alignment (see alog 74478 ). The PMC alignment has been stable since the re-tuning hence the decision to reduce the ISS diffracted power back. This gives more power out of the PSL and also increases the FSS power (transmitted power is now ~5.2).,"{'term': 'L1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",74729,adam.mullavey@ligo.org

The idea (as I follow it) is that because the 64 kHz channel has different aliasing the noise ought to look different in the two channels if it is aliasing-related. In fact the two channels look similar albeit not identical which looks like evidence against the aliasing hypothesis. However this test may not catch all the places where aliasing could occur so it may not be conclusive. See the associated detchar-request issue for ongoing discussion. The first two plots are from 2023 during time periods which were previously identified as having line contamination around the violin modes ( 71800 79825 ).

Overall bad recovery from maintenance. Here’s what happened in 7 short stories: Late LN2 Fill: NORCO arrived to fill CP8 at 00:34 UTC (16:34 PT) over 3 hours late while we were locking. Jim made EX as robust as possible such that we would survive their truck moving through. This worked though the BRS was all over the place as expected. Due to them driving <5mph as requested they took 20 minutes to arrive at EX then over 1 hr to do the fill and then another 20 minutes to get back. They left site at 02:34 UTC (18:34 PT). After NORCO left I undid Jim’s seismic configuration changes to go back to nominal. Changes made prevented locking: Earlier in the day (before NORCO arrived) we lost lock at state 557/8 TRANSITION_FROM_ETMX. I was told by the DAY operator that if this happened I was to revert Camilla’s changes in alog 82277 with regard to the DARM Boost. Since Camilla and Sheila were in the room when this happened they decided not to do it since it could have just been bad luck. Erik had also made changes regarding ramp times that affect this state. Camilla and Sheila left for the day and then NORCO arrived. While NORCO was filling we lost lock again at state 557 TRANSITION_FROM_ETMX. Camilla told me to revert her changes and Jenne told Erik to revert his. This was done by 1:31 UTC (17:31 PT). Changes reverted prevented locking: We could not lock ALS until Norco left the EX area which happened ALS locked finally at 02:10 UTC (while Norco was en route from EX). Locking then happened automatically until state 500 PREP_DC_READOUT_TRANSITION where for 10 minutes I was getting the error message “OMC not ready”. I then called Camilla who didn’t answer. I then called Erik who was still on site and came to help troubleshoot the issue (since his changes involved resetting OMs - the idea was that maybe this is related which it is likely not). After some fiddling to no avail I called Sheila (the first person on the call list) who walked me through the OMC troubleshooting process. Troubleshooting with Sheila and Erik: I informed Sheila that the error was that the OMC TF was not letting guardian continue. We did a manual OMC scan while waiting at ASC_QPD_ON to see that there indeed were triplets with 2 sidebands and one carrier with the right magnitude. We let guardian lock it and it did yielding the expected signal magnitude for the DCPD_SUM and PZT2 Monitors. Looking closely at the error Erik realized that it was the phase that was below the threshold (150) and was measuring at 144. Sheila Erik and I then decided to lower the phase threshold to 140. This worked immediately until we also lost lock just as immediately when we transitioned to DARM_TO_DC_READOUT which saturated DCPD EX EY IX and HAM6. This happened at 04:13 UTC (20:42 PT). At 4:49 UTC I reverted the phase changes to OMC_LOCK guardian since clearly something else was awry. “Did you try turning it off and back on?”: After the lockloss and the reversion we went up to lock again preparing to face the same issue DTT template and TF in hand and then… it worked. Perhaps the lockloss from earlier was from transitioning the OMC with whitening to the OMC without whitening (which I did after achieving the full OMC lock during troubleshooting). Now our next hurdle is state 557/558 (TRANSITION_FROM_ETMX). The DARM Boost is actually still on: It turns out that the DARM boost had to be turned off in two places rather than just line 3058 ( alog 82277 ) there was another later boost turn-on at line 3774. Sheila discovered this during troubleshooting at 5:15 UTC. Since we didn’t want to tempt H1 by turning off abruptly we chose to leave it on and see what would happen at 557/558. After some anticipatory sighs it worked! We automatically went all the way to NLN. 05:40 UTC - reached NLN!

19452,H1 ISC - Data in OMC DCPD Test Point Readbacks Limited by Single-Point-Precision above 7kHz when IFO is in Nominal Low Noise (and NOT limited anywhere by ADC Noise),https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=82268,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Tue, 14 Jan 2025 15:34:50 -0800","J. Kissel T. Sanchez E. Goetz L. Dartez *EDIT* This limitation is only pulling out data with test points from the A0/B0 filter outputs due to them being recorded in single precision not double precision. The actual data for all internal calculations is double precisions and in fact for the final calibrated gravitational wave strain is both calculated in and then stored in frames as double precision. Back in July 2024 when I started to characterize the super-16 kHz-Nyquist frequency data off the OMC DCPDs with the live 524 kHz channels. See LHO:78516 for the whole story but we got stalled when we ran into what we believed was some sort of single-precision numerical precision noise limited at the equivalent of 1e12 [A/rtHz] DCPD current or 1e-6 [V/rtHz] ADC voltage.In LHO:78559 we ruled out single-point precision calculation of the ASD when we ran the same DCPD signal through a special version of DTT which uses double-precision to calculate the pwelch algorithm. That version of the data proved that the high frequency limitation is still there and NOT the precision of DTT.In that same data set we also showed that if you ask DTT to remove the mean i.e. large DC component of the signal it also did NOT have any impact on this limit.And it's in removing the mean that we reveal / confirm that it is ""single-point precision"" limit in the test point readbacks . Check out 1st attachment which is the data from LHO:78559 but with no DTT calibration applied . That means the channels are calibrated into the units of whatever they are coming off of the front-end -- in this case milliamps or [mA].The DC value of the test point channel during the time of measurement was ~20 [mA].The front-end computes all its filtering in double precision but the readbacks of the products of those calculations are single-point precision. An IEEE 754 32-bit base-2 floating-point single precision channel has 24 bits of significance (excluding the sign and exponent) to hold the entire frequency dependent content of the time-series that has a DC value of ~20 [mA]. The (front end filtering algorithm?) rounds the 20.43 DC component to the nearest 2^n value i.e. 2^5 = 32 [""mA""]. Eq. 2.2 of Liquid instruments article on quantization noise suggests that the amplitude spectral density of 1 bit spread across the 0 to 2^18 Hz (f_Nyquist) frequency range over which we care is n_{ASDRMS} = sqrt( DELTA^2 / (12 * f_Nyquist) ) = DELTA * sqrt( 1 / 12 * 1/f_Nyquist ) where - DELTA is the minimum step resolution (i.e. the peak value / number of significant bits) - the factor or 1/12 comes from the expectation value of the noise power derived from the integral of the product of instantaneous noise power and the probability that that power is distributed across one specifically the least significant bit (and we use the square root because we want the amplitude not the power) - the factor of 1/f_Nyquist comes from spreading out the (presumably frequency independent ) power over the entire frequency range (and again we use square root because we want the amplitude not the power) In line-by-line math that's [[ 32 [""mA""_DC] peak value * (1/2^24) significant bits in single precision) ]] [[ 1 bit * (1/sqrt(12)) expectation value quantization noise amplitude spread across 1 bit * (1/sqrt(2^18 Hz)) quantization noise spread across 0 to Nyquist frequency range ]] = [ 32 / (2^24) ] * sqrt[ 1 / (12 * 2^18) ] = 1.07539868e-9 [""mA""/rtHz] This number *exactly* the high-frequency asymptote we see. BINGO! The next step was then to create pick-off paths of the ADC channels and high-pass -- i.e. remove the large DC component of the signal -- in the front-end. Importantly this has to be the *first* filter so the DC component is removed before any other calculation is done. We added the infrastructure and installed the filtering ( LHO:78956 LHO:78975 ) but have not come back to the data until today.Today we're finally looking at the front-end OMC DCPD data that's been high-pass filtered with a 5th order 1 Hz high-pass with 40 dB stop-band attenuation and a 1 dB ripple ellip(""HighPass""51401) The odd (5th) order means that DC component is completely suppressed leaving only the remaining frequency-dependent accumulated RMS which is 5.8901e-4 [mA_RMS] to upper limit of the dynamic range and define the precision limit.SIDE QUEST -- Fractional numbers are much less intuitive to ""just round up to the nearest power of 2^n"" so the equivalent of ""converting 20.43 [mA] to 32 [""mA""]"" for 5.8901e-4 is instead a process of Converting 5.8901e-4 to floating point binary # sign exponent fraction 0 01110100 00110100110110111110111 # round up the fraction part 0 01110100 01000000000000000000000 # convert back to decimal 0.00061035156 That takes the quantization limit down to = [ 6.1035156e-4 / (2^24) ] * sqrt[ 1 / (12 * 2^18) ] = 2.05e-14 [""mA""/rtHz] Take a look at 2nd attachment which compares the normal nominal OMC DCPD data to this 1 Hz high passed data. One can see all of the AA filtered data all the way out to the 232 kHz Nyquist frequency because that data only goes as low as 1e-13 [mA].Finally in the last attachment we re-cast this into ADC noise units to show where the data against the trace we'd had as a bench mark before. Note *this* comparison is a false comparison because the digital AA filtering is applied after the ADC noise is added. So -- don't read anything into the fact that the resolved noise goes below the ADC noise -- it's just a guide to the eye and a bench mark to remind folks that the numerical precision limit is *not* ADC noise. In conclusion if we want to investigate the OMC DCPD data above 7 kHz with test points we need to make sure to use a version where the data is high-passed significantly. So now we can actually begin doing that...CAL CDS ISC ","{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",82268,jeffrey.kissel@ligo.org

To check I put some in for P and Y in the FM7 slot and turned them on while coordinating with Jennie. Jennie saw no difference with them on or off so it confirms Jenne D's suspicions.

DartezAs we began to use the new OMC DCPD test infrastructure ( LHO:78956 LHO:78975 ) to pick up where we left off in characterizing the new-to-O4 segregated OMC DCPD 524 kHz low-noise ADC system ( LHO:78516 LHO:78559 ) we found in necessary and fruitful to - shift some of the installed filters around in the A2 and B2 banks (the one's the replicate the reverse-calibration filters that turn the raw ADC counts in mA on the DCPDs the copies of the A0 and B0 ""NewV2A"" and ""NewAW"" -- moved from FM1 and FM2 to FM2 and FM3 like they are in the A1 and B1 banks.)- add the 1 Hz 5th order elliptic high-pass as an option to the A2 and B2 filters in FM1 (like the A1 and B1 banks) and - split out ""divide-by-four"" gain of 1/4 that turns the sum of the four channels into an average from the ""cts2V"" ADC calibrating gain of 40 / 2^18 [V/ct] = 0.00015258789 [V/ct] ~ 0.0001526. The ADC gain in th previous cts2V bank was actually implemented as a typo of the 16 bit ADC calibration divided by 4. The ADC gain should be 40 / 2^16 [V/ct] = 0.000610 3 5156 [V/ct] but was installed as 0.000610 5 ""[V/ct]."" And then the multiplication of the gain of 1/2^2 = 1/4 = gain(0.25) to convert from 16-bit to 18-bit calibration was immediately adjacent to the gain(0.25) for turning the sum into an average. Not so clear.So what was cts2V = gain(0.0006105)*gain(0.25)*gain(0.25) in FM4 is now two separate filter banks 18b_cts2V = gain(0.0001526) sum2avg = gain(0.25) in FM4 and FM5.The new filter banks and arrangement have been committed to the SVN under /opt/rtcds/userapps/release/cds/h1/filterfiles/ H1IOPOMC0.txt rev 30385 Also -- it appears as though the B1 and B2 filter banks didn't have their filters properly *un*monitored when I touched the SDF system last week ( LHO:82155 ).

19473,H1 AOS - Progress on two input arm scattering issues: ITMY CP yawing causes spot on HAM3 ballast mass baffle to move; mystery beam spot comes from ITMX direction,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=82252,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:49:38 -0800",Bright beam spot on HAM3 ballast mass baffle moves with ITMY compensation plate yaw motion We have been looking for the source of the scattering noise that varies with the ITMY compensation plate yaw setting ( 80499 ). I recently searched for beam spots in the HAM3 area that move as CPY is yawed using movies that I took from both the MC2 camera viewport and the PR2 camera viewport near HAM2. Anamaria and I had done some of this before ( 77631 ) but this time I recorded the CP movements on the audio track of the movies for a more precise correlation. And I also modified the movies in iMovie to increase visibility of faint spots. Figure 1 shows that I did find a spot that moved precisely with CPY Yaw settings (link to movie clips: https://youtu.be/FDdNDPoQadU ). The spot appears to be on a ballast mass baffle (see Fig. 1) which is not angled as much as the scraper baffle (which I think the beam is supposed to fall on ( Alena's slides )) and may thus retroreflect more light. Mystery beam spot on HAM3 spool piece comes from ITMX direction not HAM2 direction I had previously misinterpreted the pattern of light on edges and bellows of the HAM3 spool piece as suggesting that the mystery beam spot ( 78192 ) was coming from the HAM2 direction . More recently I found that there was light on the HAM3 side of the MC baffle that had a similar interference pattern and was consistent with being part of the mystery beam spot (Figure 1). The light on the HAM3 side of the baffle was visible when looking through the viewport for the PRM camera at a high angle. Thus the beam is most likely coming from the ITMX direction travelling close to the –Y wall of the beam tube. One possibility is that it actually comes from ITMX either scattered light from ITMX or scattered light from the back side of MC2 reflecting off of ITMX. Figure 3 shows these suggested paths and a picture taken from the point of view of the beamspot on ITMX that shows that there is a clear path to the site of the mystery beam spot. I think that the cartoon shows that it would be worth using a real model to determine if these paths are possible. I checked to see if the beamspot on the eye baffle moved or modulated when I actuated the compensation plates. I made movies as I moved the two compensation plates more than 600 microradions in pitch and yaw but unlike the spot on the ballast mass baffle I did not see any modulation or motion of the spot on the eye baffle.

This is part of the work to understand how to move the beam on PR2 in order top avoid a reflection and subsquent stray beam off the PR2 scraper baffle (as found in alog #77631 by Annamaria and Robert). The P2L gain was close to optimised and has been left at -0.36. The commissioning window ran out before I could finish optimising the Y2L I have left it at -7.00 which gave better A2L decpupling than the previous value. Method: Inject line on PR2 M3 stage pitch at 30Hz using the OSC 9 filter bank in the ADS. sitemap-> ASC -> Dither overview Check the PIT9 filter bank at the bottom of the page is not being used (CLK gain = 0). Set the matrix at the right of the row to have a 1 in the PIT9 to PR2 cell. Check there is a ramp time in the PIT 9 filter bank. Set the frequency to 30 and step the amnplitude to 1 in a couple of steps. Measure a reference for DARM and PRCL. The red and blue traces show the case when injecting into pitch with nominal A2L gains. Set the aevraging to exponential and zoom in on the line. Change gain in HzTS->PR2-> M3 DRIVEALIGN->P2L Do this until the line height relative to the background is minimised allowing time for the ramp and a couple averages each step. One thing to note is that the line height above the background in the PRCL spectrum (LSC-PRCL_OUT_DQ) is much less than the relative height above the background in DARM which suggests that the noise in PRCL is not coupling strongly to DARM. Switch off the line and set the PIT 9 amplitude to 0 counts. Then repeat the above for the YAW 9 oscillator channel in the ADS changing the gain in the Y2L gain filter bank in order to minimise the line height. The reference values for yaw are in the photo linked above with the green line showing DARM (we had gone into NLN cal meas with SRCL FF switched off for Elenna's SRCL tests so that is why DARM shows elevated noise). The orange line is the reference value of PRCL using the nominal Y2L gain. The same amplitude was used in the oscillator for this line but it was much higher above the PRCL background noise than for the pitch degree of freedom.

This measurement works by using the radiation pressure coupling of SRCL to induce differential radiation pressure in the arms which depends on a couple factors one being the arm power. This measurement is made by injecting into the SRCL control signal and measuring the transfer function of of the relative intensity noise on the transmission QPDs of each arm to DARM. Measurement requirements: know the calibration of DARM well (must be CAL DELTA L in this case) turn off the SRCL feedforward Make sure the TMS QPDs are centered ensure high coherence (>0.9) of DARM to TMS QPDs However I once caused a lockloss running Craig's measurement templates so I wanted to be sure that I could drive hard enough to get the required coherence but not break the lock. Last week I ran a couple of test measurements with the SRCL feedforward off and the TMS QPDs as well centered as possible. I have a screenshot of the results below. You can see that the DARM/SRCL coherence is very good but the DARM/TMS QPD coherence is very bad. This is true for the NSUM channels as well as the individual segments. When I tried to drive harder I would get ETMX saturation warnings. The signal appears almost four orders of magnitude above the noise in DARM and about one order of magnitude above the noise in the TMS QPDs. The centering loops we use center onto QPD B of both arms but cause the beam to be off center on QPD A in both arms. However the coherence is equally low on both the A and B QPDs so I don't think the centering is the issue. Craig and I previously tried centering onto the A QPDs but then you become miscentered on B and also cause other problems see 67066 . Today I instead drove single lines using awggui. I was able to achieve >0.9 coherence at three different frequencies without causing any saturations anywhere at about 70 Hz 49 Hz and 34 Hz. Good coherence was observed with both the NSUM channels and the individual segments of the TMS QPDs. I also confirmed that we see the expected differential phase in the signal between the X and Y arm. We were not thermalized today so I plan to rerun this measurement on Thursday using these three points. This should be sufficient information to measure the arm power and also confirm that we observe the predicted 1/f^2 coupling. I can also use the regularly scheduled Thursday calibration measurements to make sure we know the CAL DELTA L calibration. ,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",82248,elenna.capote@ligo.org

I've been looking at the possibility of thermal coupling of localized regions of the lab temperature to the test masses. This was explored a bit previous in these alogs: Environmental to test mass thermal lens coupling: aLOG 73011 Spatial temperature variations in the LVEA: aLOG 69071 To study this I looked at a 72 hour lock from late Decemeber 2024. Over that time the AVTEMP of the LVEA stays within +/-0.1C (+/-0.15F) of the average temperature. However ZONE1 around the 3 BSC chambers (and ITMs) sees a tempreature excursion event from t=56hr to t= 64hr. This indicates that test masses may be be heated during this time which could cause transient thermal lenses (with opposite sign to the transient change in the temperature and some time delay). If we look at the Hartmann sensor data we indeed see negative lenses start to form around t=58hrs. Some Finesse modeling earlier indicated that the 9MHz PRG will be impacted by this. We do see a corresponding change in RF18 signal strength as indicated here. However there is no corresponding change in the range (at least nothing significant). Finally there is some indication from tracking fluctiations in test mass eigenmodes that the test masses are getting warmer (due to increasing eigenmode frequencies). The time delay between the lab temperature change and test mass eigenmode change looks to be about 4 hours. This is more circumstantial. The interplay of time delays here needs to be properly understood. TCS ,"{'term': 'L1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",74834,aidan.brooks@ligo.org

19547,LLO General - DQ LLO Shift 12/16/2024 - 12/22/2024,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=74826,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Tue, 14 Jan 2025 09:43:43 -0600",DQ Shift Report here . The duty cycle of L1 was 84.3% on average this week. Most of the lock losses were either due to earthquake wind or commissioning. There was one that had no apparent reason. (Earthquake: 17th 21st 22nd.Commisioning: 17th 19th.Unknown cause: 18th.) The range fluctuated between 145 and 175 Mpc throughout the week. Sometimes there was a drop in range mostly due to ground motion such as at 07:30 UTC and 22:00 UTC on 17th Dec 07:00 UTC on 18th Dec 22:00 UTC on 21st Dec and 21:20 UTC on 22nd Dec. There was some low-frequency noise in the h(t) spectrogram on December 19th (from 10 to 30 Hz possibly related to L1:LSC-REFL_A_RF9_Q_ERR_DQ based on Hveto round 1 results) December 21st (from 10 to 50 Hz possibly related to L1:LSC-REFL_A_RF9_Q_ERR_DQ based on Hveto round 1 results) and December 22nd (from 10 to 30 Hz possibly related to wind and L1:LSC-REFL_A_RF9_Q_ERR_DQ based on Hveto round 1 results). There was some periodic low frequency noise present in the BSCs throughout the week. There was low frequency noise (~7-8 Hz) in all the acoustics throughout almost the week. There was also a cluster of noise burst present in the acoustics on 22nd December. Hveto: There were some new channels throughout the week. In general there was a different channel every day. The most frequent channel is L1:LSC-REFL_A_RF9_Q_ERR_DQ which appeared 7 times. Fscan: All the plots have appeared. The line count ranged from about 340 to 510 and all of them were below the threshold. Special events: (1) Lockloss at 05:06 UTC 18th Dec was due to unknown cause and possible noise today might be due to a weather front. (2) The range drop was caused by being out of the observing squeezer at 13:32 21st Dec ( aLog_74596 ). (3) The low frequency (10 - 30 Hz) noise between 19:40 - 24:00 UTC on 22nd Dec might be caused by wind. And there was a cluster of noise (5 -1000 Hz) between 06:10 - 08:15 UTC corelating with drop and improvement in the L1 binary neutron star inspiral range (DMT SenseMon).

I drive from the M1 V excitation point deactivating the bandstop for Bounce/Roll. I read out in the M1_DAMP_V_IN1 M2 OSEMS and the M3 OpLev . Signal was clearest in OpLev Pitch and Yaw. OpLev Pitch some broader response that was skewing both the magnitude and phase response to which the Yaw was less susceptible to. I fit what I saw in the OpLev Yaw response and rotated the phase such that at the approximate peak the phase response would be 90 degreess. Here is the hand fitting (I had difficultly doing automated fitting with complex data). The bounce mode is approximately at 16.797 Hz with a Q of 550 . In line with Masayuki's ringdown measurement [ 58663 ]. In air measurements had this at 180 [ 55677 ]. I'm working on expanding the Band-Stop in the Bound bank in the MICH_L controller to remove broad non-linear response around the band stops of the Bound and Roll mode to improve the quality on injections for MICHFF and ultimately rework and clean up nastyness around the Bounce mode seen in the last figure of [ 74547 ] to get a better overall MICHFF subtraction.
