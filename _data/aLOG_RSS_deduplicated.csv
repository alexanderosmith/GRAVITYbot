24404,H1 ISC - SPI Pick-off Path Install Day Three; Midday Report -- Power to ALS/SQZ Fiber Distribution Path Restored,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=83978,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:18:32 -0700","J. Kissel scribe for S. Koehlenbeck J. Freed R. Short and guest star J. OberlingECR E2400083IIET 30642WP 12453Toward the end of day two of install ( LHO:83961 ) the team set the power at the input of the ALS-FC2 by rotating ALS-HWP2 to be 50.5 [mW] (with PMC TRANS at 103.5 [W]). The reported power for the on-table ThorLabs SM1PD1A however measured consistently lower at ""31 [mW]"" lower than the goal for this PD a reported power of ""45 [mw]"" ( LHO:83927 ) when the power of the beam between ALS-M9 and ALS-FC2 was physically measured at 48.7 [mW] (with PMC TRANS at 103.0). We think lower reported power on the PD is related to (1) The slight translation of the what-used-to-be ALS-L5 to ALS-M9 beam because of the thickness of the SPI-BS1 that was inserted into that path and (2) a change in the amount of s- and p- polarization in reflection of the ALS-PBS01 after rotating ALS-HWP2 to increase the power in the ALS/SQZ/SPI path because the polarization state of the reflection of a PBS can be power dependent.To support (2) we measured the polarization today between ALS-M9 and ALS-FC2 with a temporary PBS and power meter. On 2025-04-17 at 19:02 UTC with PMC power at 103.7 [W] we measure s-pol = 49.7 [mW] p-pol = 1.8 [mW] (total = 49.7 + 1.8 = 51.5 [mW]) Regrettably we did not measure this polarization state prior to changing anything.However because we've *measured* equal total power at ALS-FC2 before vs. after we're confident that at least the total power going into ALS-FC2 is the same. As such we called in Jason to help couple the beam into ALS-FC2 using ALS-M9 and what alignment screws are on ALS-FC2 itself. Attached is the trend of that process where we used the SPI distribution chassis PD in two forms: H1:ALS-C_FIBR_INTERNAL_DC_POWER never calibrated version used to be 0.1 [cts] H1:ALS-C_FIBR_INTERNAL_DC_POWERMON version we'd been using calibrated into [mW] In the end we landed with the values of these channels at H1:ALS-C_FIBR_INTERNAL_DC_POWER 0.1 [cts] H1:ALS-C_FIBR_INTERNAL_DC_POWERMON 31.4 [mW] which matches our goals from LHO:83927 .The team also adjusted the position of the SM1PD1A in transmission of ALS-M9 to account for (1). However even after moving the PD out of maximum and back they were not able to find any position where the PD readout exceeded H1:ALS-C_FIBR_EXTERNAL_DC_POWERMON 31.0 [mW] This why we expect that something more like (2) is going on. Though we looked through - E1300483 (doesn't list ALS-M9) - E1900246 (calls the optic ALS-M6 which is not for 1064 nm in E1300483) - E0900325 (isn't new enough to have this mirror) - Peter King's purchase orders circa 2019 (Req 122638553 for the fiber collimator parts and Req 122583017 for the SM1PD1A parts)we couldn't find anything that was clearly and obviously the ALS-M9 optic so we can't validate or reconstruction the reflectivity in each polarization to model the factor of 31 [mW] / 45 [mW] = 0.7x (or 30% drop) reported value change.In any event this EXTERNAL PD channel will need to be recalibrated to better reflect the real power in this path. Also when we re-start up anything that uses the output of the ALS / SQZ fiber distribution it may need to be adjusted to account for the polarization change described in (2) PSL SQZ ","{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",83978,jeffrey.kissel@ligo.org

Status of things as we go 1. The estimator is OFF. We set the damping of M1 Yaw back to -0.5. 2 There are new YAW estimator blends in the SR3 model. These were put into foton with autoquack. The foton file in userapps was committed to the SVN 3. We updated the safe.snap SDF file with a decent version of the OFF estimator. We HAVE NOT updated the observing.snap file. At this point all the estimator settings should be the same in safe and observing. (I'm not sure how to update the observing.snap file) 4. All the work on the estimator design is all committed to the {SUS_SVN}/sus/trunk/HLTS/Common/FilterDesign/Estimator/ -- some detailed notes on the blend design and svn commits follow -- Design new blend filters load them into the model commit the updated foton file seems like a 2% error in the peak finding makes a bunch of noise in the estimator with the agressive blend and is not a reasonable error (judgement call by Brian and Edgard) >> print -dpng fig_2pcnt_error.png >> print -dpng fig_2pcnt_error_result.png Check noise again with 2% error in model/actual using the robust blend (EB blend) - we see the peaks are not any better. I can't get a broad notch for notch 3 without causing the OSEM filter to be larger than 1. Issue seems to be the freq of the notches going past 60 deg. Could be tuned further. Instead - use a simple notch. This means we'll need to be quite accurate with the 3 peak - probably withing 0.5% of the actual frequency figures gain error - no performance hit 2% freq error - clear perf hit 1% freq error - acceptable perf hit - top mode clearly worse but only a little 0.5% freq error - tiny perf hit at top mode only print -dpng fig_perf1_gainerror.png >> print -dpng fig_perf2_0p5freqerror.png >> print -dpng fig_perf3_1p0freqerror.png >> print -dpng fig_perf4_perfectmatch.png turn the script into a blend design script - Estimator_blend_doublenotch_SR3yaw.m update the yaw frequencies to 1.016 2.297 3.385 can we use autoquack? - yes!

They are showed in the H1:OMC-DCPD_A_WINDOW_{MAXMIN} that sum the 4 DC photodiodes (DCPD). They are 18 bits DCPD so that channel should saturate at 4* 2^17 ~520000 counts. Now there are instances that agree with Ansel report when there are violin mode ring up that we can see a shift in the count baseline. Jun 29 - Jun 30 2023 when the baseline seems to shift up and stay there for >1 months Detchar summary page show significant higher violin mode ring up in the usual 500-520Hz region as well as the nearby region (480-500 Hz) Oct 9 2023 is when the temporary calibration lines are turned off 72096 the down shift happened right after the lines are off (after 16:40 UTC) During this period we were using a~5% of the ADC range (difference between max and min channel divided by the total range - 500000 to 500000 counts) and it went down to ~2.5 % once the shift happenned on Oct 9 2023. We want to do something similar with Livingston using the L1:IOP-LSC0_SAT_CHECK_DCPD_{AB}_{MAXMIN} channels to see the ADC range and the typical count values of those channels. Another thing for us to maybe take a closer look is the baseline count value increase around May 03 2023. There was a change to the DCPC total photocurrent during that time ( 69358 ). Maybe worth checking if there is violin mode contaimination during the period before that. DetChar ,"{'term': 'H1 DetChar', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",83997,kiet.pham@ligo.org

That initial beam profile measurement is cited in LHO:83956 and the lens also developed in JaMMT with the lenses that were available from the optics lab / PSL inventory.- If anyone's trying to recreate the model of the beam profile from the two measurements ( LHO:83956 with no lenses and the above LHO:83983 ) just note that the ""zero"" position is different in the quoted raw data in LHO:83956 is the front of the rail on Column 159 of the table and in LHO:83983 the zero position is the SPI-BS1 reflective surface which is on Column 149 of the table i.e. a 10 inch = 25.4 cm difference.- The real SPI-L1 installed to create this mode-shape / beam profile is labeled by its radius of curvature which is R = 51.5 mm and thus its focal length is more precisely f = R*2 = 103 mm. (We did find a lens that does have f = 60 mm for SPI-L2 and it's labeled by its focal length.)- ""the fiber"" is that which is intended for permanent use depicted as SPI_PSL_001 in the SPI optical fiber routing diagram D2400110 a Narrow Key PM-980 Optical Fiber ""patch cord"" from Diamond whose length is 30 [m]. This fiber will run all the way out to SUS-R2 eventually to be connected as the input to the SPI Laser Prep Chassis ( D2400156 ).- Per design light going into this fiber is entirely p-pol due to polarization via SPI-HWP1 and clean-up by SPI-PBS01 just upstream. We did not measure the polarization state of the light exiting the fiber.- The raw data that informs the statement that ""the power transmission thru the fiber has been measured to be 83%"": : We measured the input to the fiber coupler SPI-FC1 via the S140C low-power power meter we'd been using throughout the install. The output power was measured via a fiber-coupled power meter Sina had brought with her from Stanford (dunno the make of that one). : We measured the power input to the fiber twice several hours apart (with the change in fiber input power controlled via the SPI-HWP1 / SPI-PBS01 combo).

Alberto Jorge TJ Huyen] We found that the difference is quite large (~200kg) between balancing solution (+ISC payload) and the weight we used to test this ISI on the test stand ( E2300100 - page 16 ). This weight diff will prevent us from getting the ISI lockers free. While waiting for the balancing solution to be updated we reloaded the HEPI spring with the current ISI weight roughly survey the ISI in place (within 2mm) using HEPI springs with ""build and inspect"" feature in FARO which pointed to 3 different points on the ISI table (see figure 1 - FARO example before moving the ISI). Note that these excercises will be repeated/retuned once we have the correct payload on the table. I got the HAM1 ISI partly cabled up from in-vac side (everything except for the actuators). I'm still troubleshooting the problem that the BIO switch doesn't work. Some of the cable wiring errors from the diagram D2200162-v3 got corrected but gain is still not correct for GS13. Regardless of the incorrect gain at the first glance all sensors spectra seems to overlapped well between corners see figure 2 . More testings to come. Eddie updated the mass solution D1200428-v7 to get the payload closer to what we expect. The corner (except HAM1) is pumping down so we are on standby.

We got the waist position between the WFS to match pretty closely (red dots in plot) but the waist size is off by about a factor of 2. We chose to align along the x-axis since the jdsu beam is very astigmatic and it was prohibitively cumbersome to get the thorlabs camera to give believable readings for both axes in all our tests. ... hoping for a cleaner beam in chamber.Further fine-tuning will be saved for when we're in HAM1 and have a REFL signal. The setup is shown in refl_sled_input_opticslab.png and refl_sled_opticslab.png .I manually aligned the mirrors to approximately what we'll need for the WFS in chamber. The beam dumps were also placed preliminarily. Outside of the L101 L202 distance we're likely to need to adjust mirrors once we have light in HAM1. ,"{'term': 'L1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",76346,louis.dartez@ligo.org

Issac Garrett TJ Jorge] We got back to HAM1 yesterday afternoon and populated the HAM1 ISI with the new mass layout ( D1200428-v7 ). Today (1) we moved the ISI in position as best as we can with the help of FARO device monitoring 3 points on the ISI see figure 1 . The X-Y-Z positions are within 1.5mm 0.7mm 0.1mm respectively. We will go with this position considering the gap between the HEPI booth (moving joint) and the housing is quite small now (~2-3mm). This gap should be preserved in case we have to operate HEPI in the future. Moving the housing to open up this gap is not our choice because of the interest of time and the hassle it may cause. Note to IAS: To assure that the table is level locally the Z values of reference points were moved in the FARO-PolyWork software from global coordinate flat to LVEA local coordinate flat which is only 0.04mm difference from HAM1 local coordinate in Z. Below is the HAM1 HEPI sping load: Left Right Pier_1 1837 1220 Pier_2 1493 1544 Pier_3 1471 1278 Pier_4 1400 814 (2) We recentered the HEPI lockers better now that the HEPI moved to the new location. (3) While HEPI still free we re-attached the actuators while monitoring the HEPI crossbeam position at each pier with the posts described in alog 76011 . All of them moved within 0.3mm max see example of a pier motion change in figure 2 . After releasing the shims on the HEPI actuators all looks okay except for the vertical actuators on pier 2 and 3 which look off-center.

The more detailed activity logs are provided at the bottom but some of the more noteworthy tasks are summarised here: We inspected and where necessary cleaned (top gun and drag wiping) the optics. The 532nm HR mirror in M11 (see D1000313-v18 for optical layout) had what looked like scratches in the middle so we replaced this optic. In the POP path we changed the siskiyou mount in M15 from RH to LH and changed it's optic from an HR mirror to Rp=50% beam-splitter. In the old optical layout - D1000313-v15 M15 was just a steering mirror but in the new lay-out it's the beam-splitter that splits the POP beam between LSC and ASC paths. It's also a pico-mirror so the pico actuators had to be swapped to the new mount. Also in the POP path the beam-splitter in M12 was changed from Rp=95% to Rp=90% to double the amount of the light passing through to the LSC and ASC PDs which with the 50/50 beam-splitter maintains the same power on the LSC RFPD. Oriented the optic bases and where necessary swapped them for longer ones to line up with the ISI screw holes (again based on D1000313-v18 ).

The duty-cycle was modified by removing earthquake times (ground motion in the 0.03-0.1 Hz band above 150 nm/sec) from lock duration and day duration. Conclusion: We found the evidence of linear correlation between microseismic ground motion and duty-cycle except for Hanford O3 and O4a (2023) winters. For Hanford useismic ground motion affected the duty-cycle in O4b winter (2024-25) only ( see figure ).

It seems possible that there was a mix up where design documents call for a distance of 97cm between the OMC waist and OM2 and the as built distance is 97 cm between the OMC input coupler and OM2 (so the OMC seems to be translated by 14 cm from where the mode matching design expected it to be). If we have the q parameter used in the design (ROC matched to SRM beam size there is 2.1mm) this would introduce a 1% mismatch between the OMC mode and the SRC mode (the impact could be larger for a different q parameter). Note that the analysis done in 71145 was using the design distances so we will want to revisit that. I've attached an a la mode script below. Editing to add more information: I initially did this with the design ROC for OM2 which is 1.7meters which is also what is in Finesse. This results in an overlap for the design locations of 99.95% and 99% for the as built locations with the as built waist location 12cm from the OMC waist location (there are differences in the other distances that partially cancel the 14cm difference between OMC input coupler and OMC waist location) and a waist size of 545um compared to the OMC eigenmode of 509um. In 71145 Keita says that the OM2 ROC is 2m cold and 1.75m hot. If we change the OM2 curvature for the as built path to 2 meters the overlap becomes 93.8% and the waist location becomes 14.3cm from the OMC waist location with a waist size of 649um. Using the hot ROC of 1.75m the overlap becomes 98.5% and the waist is 563um 11.5cm from the OMC waist. So if our q parameter was the design one at SRM the error in OM2 curvature would be compounding the error in the OMC placement to make the mode matching worse. The single bounce measurements agree that the mode matching is worse with OM2 cold than hot but the full IFO measurements are the opposite. Summarizing distances: T1000317 : OMC waist to OM3: 26.8 cm OMC waist to OM2: 97.6 cm OMC waist to OM1: 2.37 m OMC waist to SRM: 6.017 m T1200410 says we should have: OMC waist to OM3: 26.2cm OMC waist to OM2: 97 cm OMC waist to OM1: 2.365 m OMC waist to SRM: 5.936 m . yaml file which is based on E2100383 : OMC input coupler to OM3: 30.4cm OMC input coupler to OM2: 97.1cm OMC input coupler to OM1: 2.416m OMC input coupler to SRM: 5.858 m Camilla looking at edrawings (which agree with photos): OMC input coupler to OM3: 30.1cm OMC input coupler to OM2 95.5cm OMC input coupler to OM1: 2.4meters To compare the solid works to the photos we looked at D0901822 and compared it to OM3 photo and this photo of OM2 when it was a tip tilt. Using the beam q from table 1 of T1200410 for just after SRM and propagating it through the distances from T1000317 gives an overlap with the OMC waist of 99.96%. Adjusting the SRM to OM1 distance to agree with T1200410 gives 99.95% so that difference between the two design documents isn't significant.

I took some ITMY M0 transfer functions yesterday afternoon with the ISI in Isolated to check out any possible correlations there.

24896,H1 SUS - Comment to OSEM estimator summary,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84087,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:35:28 -0700",Here is a comparison of the spectra of three channels that can be used to monitor the performance of the estimator. We compare the motion when the M0 Yaw damping loop gain is at -0.5 versus when it is at the -0.1 (which is what we are aiming for with the estimator). The equivalent estimator plots should look somewhere in between the purple and blue curves in the images attached. - The first one is the OPLEV on SR3. If the estimator works we should be able to see a difference on the mode Qs. The oplev should see that we are able to damp (or control) the modes to the same level as the -0.5 damping. - The second one is the M1 OSEM spectrum. The closed loop spectrum dips at the resonances of the plant at -0.5 gain (because of the sensitivity function) so we should be able to see that the sensitivity (as seen by the OSEM) is different but the OPLEV sees good control of the modes. - The third one is the total drive on M1. We should see that the total drive around the resonances is similar to the drive we get with the -0.5 gain but the total drive should decrease rapidly above 3 or so Hz. We will need a faster channel than the one shown in the last attachment. The plan is to make a full list of channels to monitor in conversation with Oli and Jeff then run a pilot test with the fits from 84041 later in the week. ,"{'term': 'H1 SUS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",84087,edgard.bonilla@ligo.org

Warner R. Crouch J. Oberling Took another look at WHAM1 ISI alignment this morning after the HEPI actuators were attached yesterday . The total station occupied monument LV25 and we used LV26 as the backsight. The autolevel was placed sighting 171.9 mm on the scale we attached to height mark 600 placing it +100.0 mm above the ISI target z-axis position. Measurements and calculations done as detailed in alog 84057 . We initially found the ISI a little off level it was high on the -X side so Jim did a small correction for that (it has to be small since there is much less range in HEPI with the actuators attached). Final positional deviations from the ISI target of [-22726.7 0.0 -201.9] mm are: X axis: +0.8 mm Y axis: +1.9 mm Z axis: +0.15 mm Yaw: 96 µrad CCW Level to within 0.38 mm Tolerances for position are +/- 3.0 mm in all axes (reusing tolerances from aLIGO install) I don't find a yaw tolerance in my aLIGO install notes so we tried to minimize it while making other adjustments I'd say <100 µrad is pretty good. Jim says the level is good so this ends IAS for the WHAM1 ISI for now. IAS equipment has been taken down although we still have it in the general area should there be a need to take another look at the ISI before the chamber is closed. Based on the above deviations the WHAM1 ISI coordinates in the LHO global coordinate frame are [-22725.9 +1.9 -201.75] mm. Data and Calculations Data and calculations for the above results.

Todd C. Compton S. Dwyer This is a continuation of the last alog discussing how we can estimate thermal actuator contributions to the surface curvature to the test masses. In this I tried to layout the problem with a little more detail. Essentially with a few different ring heater powers and their corresponding HOM spacing measurements from OMC data we can estimate the coupling factor of ring heater power to test mass surface defocus [D/W]. The assumption is that the cavity g-factor is linear with this ring-heater power dependence and higher order terms are assumed to be small enough to ignore. This fit to a premlinary dataset (one HOM data point per ring-heater power_) yields a ring-heater coupling value of 0.6483 uD/W -- note: the HOM spacing has been observed to change during the same ring heater powers over time and these should be included in the dataset. This value is about 65% of what we think it to be from TCS - SIM. We can also constrain the HOM spacing shift from self-heating alone using the intercept of this curve -- this is estimated to be about 153 Hz (from 5166Hz to 5319Hz) compared to the predicted 411Hz change.

Guardian was modified to accomodate this. Safe SDF for PMC and FSS were updated.

Depending on who wrote what sometimes 1 means ON sometimes -1 some other times -30000 and these status were cdsEpicsInput which are floating point. Now they're cdsEpicsBinIn which is binary ON is 1 OFF is 0.) Model changes: I pulled pslfss and pslpmc model from svn to close the FRS above. We'll have to keep some local modifications unique to LHO at least until the end of the run. Due to local changes the models will not be committed to SVN upstream. Changed models: ${userapps}/release/psl/common/models/pslfss.mdl ${userapps}/release/psl/common/models/pslpmc.adl ${userapps}/release/psl/h1/models/h1pslfss.mdl. See the first two screen shots. Local modifications 1: Adding back CALI filters. These filters are not used any more from this point on. However removing these from DAQ means that we cannot trend the data of these back without using NDS2 and specifying epoch which is not a great thing to do in the middle of the run. Added back PSL-FSS_TEST1_ON_CALI and PSL_FSS_TEST2_ON_CALI filters to pslfss common model but grounded all of them. Added back PSL-PMC_TF_IN_ON_CALI PSL-PMC_LOCK_ON_CALI RAMP_ON_CALI BLANKING_CALI BOOST_CALI filters to pslpmc common model but grounded all of them. See the first and second screen shot (red in the left panel). Local modifications 2: Move NPRO_TEMP_OUT out of the common model and into the H1 model. Dave originally added NPRO_TEMP_OUT channel to DAQ at 256Hz locally to the common FSS model in May 2023. However he moved it to h1pslfss. Local modifications 3: Don't change binary to DAC count and convert it back to binary There was such a block in the common PMC model in the SVN (1st screen shot right panel green) which was eliminated in the local common model for the sake of simplicity. Local modifications 4 (cosmetic): Define a constant representing DAC count that will produce +10V in the model. Blue in the first two screen shots. Dave thinks that this needs to be in the top level of local models (not in the common model) right before the signal goes to DAC in the future. That way when we upgrade the DAC we can just change the constant. MEDM changes: Manually changed: ${userapps}/release/psl/common/medm/PSL_PMC.adl as the file on SVN still uses the old logic. Pulled from SVN: ${userapps}/release/psl/common/medm/PSL_FSS.adl and ${userapps}/release/psl/common/medm/FSS/MAN.adl (and other things in FSS directory).

HEPI was then unlocked and I looked at how much we disturbed the IPS and dial indicators. 2 IPS were bad enough I locked the foot at that pier and adjusted the actuator to better center the IPS. According to the dial indicators we moved about 1/3-1/2 mm +X. Tomorrow we will take another round of measurements with Jason and decide to go from there. I think we might want to do some careful sub-1/4mm moves but Jason's numbers will be the deciding point. We may also want to finish some small parts installs in chamber before handing the chamber back to ISC.","{'term': 'H1 SEI', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",84071,jim.warner@ligo.org

It appears as if we have a non-minimum phase zero that appears and dissappears between measurements [see page 20 of the original post above]. While I don't have a full explanation for this behavior I remember seeing these shenanigans when I was testing the ISI feedforward many years ago. I was too young to make any coherent argument about it but I remember seeing that the state of the ISI seemed correlated with the behavior. If the ISI is ISOLATED we have normal behavior if it is DAMPED then we have the non-minimum phase behavior. Here is a comparison between the last few years of successful ITMY M0 to M0 transfer functions with the ISI states retrieved from plotallquad_dtttfs.m. The color coding is selected to separate the situations with the ISI in 'ISO' and with the ISI in any other state. in pseudocode: switch ISI-STATE case 'Isolated' color='blue' case 'Damped' color='red' case 'Locked' color='black' otherwise color='magenta' end I note that with this small sample size we indeed see that all of the cases with the ISI in ISOLATED look the same with the correct zero behavior that the MATLAB QUAD model would have as well. As for the DAMPED state there is one outlier and it is the measurement from 2017-12-20. The reason for the discrepancy is unclear to me. I will try to get a larger sample size by looking at other QUADs later. Stay tuned! SUS ,"{'term': 'H1 SUS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",84058,edgard.bonilla@ligo.org

This is done using a total station for measuring X and Y axis position and ISI yaw and an autolevel for measuring ISI height and level. X Axis Position and Yaw 2 sets of crossed scales are used with the total station to make the required measurements. These scales are mounted in such a way that one edge of the vertical scale lines up with the y-axis centerline of the ISI a second scale is mounted horizontally to give a reading of the x-axis position of that location. The 2 sets of scales are mounted to the outermost holes on the +Y and -Y side of the ISI see the attached picture for an example (the right-most edge of the vertical scales are in line with the ISI y-axis centerline). The -Y scale mount also has a mounting hole for a corner cube retroreflector which gives us the ability to used the total station's Electronic Distance Measurement (EDM) function to measure the distance between the total station and the outermost -Y holes of the ISI. There is a brass monument on the floor to the East of WHAM1 that the total station is set over this is monument LV25 coordinates [-22726.7 -3050.7] mm. The total station the sights monument LV26 (cooridnates [-2133.6 -3050.7] mm) which is down by WHAM4 and this line sets our horizontal angle to zero. The total station is then turned -90° to point at the center of WHAM1. We then use the total station to read the horizontal scale of each set of crossed scales to get a measurement to calculate x-axis position deviation and ISI yaw the distance between the outermost holes 2082.8 mm (taken from the SolidWorks model of the ISI) gives us the needed info to calculate the yaw. Using the numbers for the final measurements from the above main alog as an example the calculation looks like this: +Y scale reading: 0.0 mm -Y scale reading: +0.5 mm X axis position deviation: (0.5 + 0.0) / 2 = +0.25 mm Yaw: (0.5 - 0.0) / 2082.8 = 240 µrad CCW Y Axis Position A corner cube retroreflector is mounted to the -Y scale mount designed in such a way so the measurement point of the corner cube lines up with the outermost row of holes. From the SolidWorks model of the ISI this outermost row of holes is 1041.4 mm from the center of the ISI. The total station occupies monument LV25 which has a y-axis coordinate of -3050.7 mm. Since the ISI should be at a y-axis coordinate of 0.0 mm we then use the total station's EDM function to measure the distance from the total station to the corner cube. The target distance is the y-axis coordinate of monument LV25 minus the y-axis coordinate of the outermost -Y holes of the ISI or |-3050.7 - (-1041.4)| = 2009.3 mm. Using the numbers from the Initial measurements (since we did not take a final look at y-axis position yesterday afternoon) in the above main alog as an example the calculation is: Total Station EDM: 2009.7 mm Target Distance: 2009.3 mm Y axis position deviation: 2009.7 - 2009.3 = +0.4 mm Z Axis Position and Level For the z-axis position deviation and ISI level we use an autolevel and a scale set at various points on the ISI. The autolevel is set to +100.0 mm above the target ISI height using height mark 600 (on the East wall across from WHAM1). From T1100187 the LHO local coordinate for this height mark is -249.7 mm. We set a scale on this height mark with 10.0 mm on the scale lining up with the height mark. We can then calculate what scale reading required to set the autolevel at +100.0 mm above the target height of the ISI. The LHO global z-axis coordinate for the WHAM1 ISI is -201.9 mm but the height mark is in LHO local so we have to translate between the two coordinate systems. This means we have to add 14.1 mm 1 to the LHO global coordinate to get the LHO local coordinate for the WHAM1 ISI doing this the LHO local coordinate for the ISI is -187.8 mm. Now the delta between the WHAM1 ISI z-axis position and height mark 600 is calculated then add 100.0 mm to that to set the autolevel 100.0 mm above the target ISI height we have to also add 10.0 mm since that's where the scale was set on the height mark: |-249.7 - (-187.8)| + 100.0 + 10.0 = 171.9 mm. So sighting 171.9 mm on the scale we mounted on height mark 600 puts the autolevel 100.0 mm above the target z-axis position of the ISI. With the autolevel set we then place a scale at several points on the ISI and use the autolevel to read the scale at each point. The scale we have for this is in inches and has tic marks at every 0.01"". Since the autolevel is 100.0 mm above the target ISI height we should be reading 3.94"" (100.0 / 25.4 = 3.94) on the scale if the ISI is at the correct height reading a lower number on the scale means the ISI is too high and reading a higher number on the scale means the ISI is too low. The scale is placed at the 4 corners of the ISI with a reading taken at each point. These 4 readings are averaged to give the height of the ISI table. For the table level the delta between the highest and lowest scale reading is used. Using the numbers from the final measurements from the above main alog this calculation looks like: -X/+Y scale reading: 3.905"" -X/-Y scale reading: 3.915"" +X/+Y scale reading: 3.915"" +X/-Y scale reading: 3.915"" Average: 3.913"" Z axis deviation: 3.94 - 3.913 = 0.027"" => +0.69 mm Level: 3.915 - 3.905 = 0.01"" => 0.25 mm 1: The 14.1 mm correction comes from removing the global x-axis tilt of -619.5 µrad done by multiplying the x-axis tilt by the x-axis position of the WHAM1 chamber: -22726.7 * -.0006195 = +14.1 mm.

The measured NLG matches the NLG infered from anti-squeezing and squeezing for the NLG 19 measurements but for the NLG 35 measurements the infered NLG is 27.3 so that is what I've used here. As Camilla wrote above the NLG 35 measurements were made with a different SRC detuning than NLG19 so that is included in this model. Squeezing angles are fit to the band from 2100 Hz to 2300 Hz. The first plot shows the measured data in solid lines the quantum noise model in dashed lines and the dotted lines show the non quantum noise from subtraction added to the quantum noise models. There is a discrepancy where many of the measurements seem to have extra noise from 20-50 Hz I've tried to make an easier to read version in the second plot and finally removed some traces to try to make it easier to see. In the above alog we thought perhaps that this could be explained as an excess noise that was larger with higher nonlinear gain but consistent with squeezing angle the last attachment shows the residuals between the model and measurement for the measurements that had clear discrepancies they all seem to be different so this excess seems to depend both on squeezing angle and nonlinear gain.

Following up on the fits for the SR3 estimator. I ran the plotall scripts on the transfer functions we took last Friday [see 84003 ]. Then ran the attached code to fit the transfer functions. Figure 1 shows the ISI-M1 fitted transfer function. The Q-factors for the fit were tweaked by hand so I could get a decent fit. The exported M1 to M1 transfer function is shown in the second attachment. I decided it should have the same poles as the ISI one and the gain was fit so the estimator matches the high-frequency behavior of the measured transfer function. The choice to share poles is because the math indicates that it will lead to some potential modeling errors cancelling out.

I've updated the puppet config for h1daqnds0 to make this a persistent change.At this point I am running the new frame writer on h1daqfw2 and it is producing frames. I need to do some more configuration (mainly around the run number server) so the frames will be identical to those output from the other frame writers (the difference should be in metadata in the frame headers not the recorded data). In simulated data setups I have produced frames that are byte for byte identical to daqd frames so it is fairly likely that after I get that working I will see identical frames.The point of this frame writer is to move towards a auto-reconfiguring/restartless system that is able to adjust on the fly to channel changes remove some other limitations in the daqd and to become the ngdd projects frame writer for downstream derived data products.The first things I will look at with this is memory and cpu requirements under the H1 load.This testing will be ongoing.,"{'term': 'H1 DAQ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",84040,jonathan.hanks@ligo.org

This got the payload close enough that we could start thinking about initial alignment. After lunch we went out and squeezed 4 more dial indicators on the north side of the chamber. This was pretty difficult getting 2 under the chamber and then attaching 2 more with magnetic bases to the HAM2 crossbeams. With that we were able to start putting weight on the HEPI springs. We went to each corner backed all of the stops off till they were barely touching the foot except for the 3 stops holding the corner up. We then evenly loaded the springs on one pier until the bottom stops were free while watching dial indicators to make sure nothing moved too much. Once all 4 corners were floating on springs we called Jason and Ryan out to set up and take position shots with the total station. All of us very much missed the Faro for the next 90 minutes. When they were set up and got a measurement I went around and tweaked the springs until the ISI was within more or less +/- 1mm. Table is level to about 1/4 mm across the 4 points we measured. Table yaw I think was out about 250 urad but hopefully Jason can put some numbers up later. Tomorrow the plan is to lock HEPI again verify we haven't disturbed the position and start reattaching actuators.

It's odd - the yaw looks very lightly damped - but the IFO was in observe. You can not see real motion above the 3.4 ish Hz yaw mode (it should be falling faster that 1/f^6). You might be seeing real motion between the peaks though - and we can use that (peaks at 1 2.3 3.4). (environment was pretty quiet - BLRMS - EQ is 40-100 nm/sec microseism is 200-400 nm/sec wind speed below 1 m/s anthropogenic is 20-30 nm/sec.

Ignoring seismic input (which is completely fair) the signal here should just be yaw_osem_noise * (1/1-G) (the minus sign assumes you get all the loop gain signs directly from the control). You can see dips at the resonances so the loop is on and has some gain but not much at the 1 Hz mode more at 3.4 ish Hz. I've also added my yaw noise reference from G2002065 - you can see here that the noise is a bit larger than my estimate above 1 Hz. LDVW shows that the gain on the M1_DAMP_Y control was already turned down to -0.5 at this time.

We checked the RM sat amps and they have no bias. If the Sat Amp PDs are connected as shown om D080276 the OSEM values will be negative. Indeed the RMs had negative OSEM values as expected. However all ZMs have positive values since nobody bothered to flip the pins. We propose to no longer flip the PD pins for the RMs and work with positive OSEM values in the future.,"{'term': 'H1 AOS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",84027,daniel.sigg@ligo.org

First I shined a flashlight through the ITMY elliptical baffle towards the BS. Figure 1 shows that this produced a 45 degree annular beam similar to the one observed during lock that I noted here ( 83050 ) consistent with the hypothesis that it is a reflection from the BS cage (see linked alog). Second our entry through BSC8 also reminded me that LHO has some unique potential scattering sites that LLO does not have. Figure 2 shows that several of the blanked off nozzles in BSC8 act as corner retroreflectors visible to the beam spot on ITMY and there is a reflection from the chamber just below the beam. A look at my compilation of beam spot photos from several years ago ( 41142-Figure3 ) also shows these issues at ITMX (second page of Fig. 2). We should probably put in nozzle baffles next time we are in-chamber near BSC8 and 7.

In a first attempt to study potential scattered light noise problems from these beams before the break I injected 0.2 Hz X and Y motion onto the BS HEPI with motion amplitudes of about 1e-6 m at stages 0 and 2 (see figure). The figure demonstrates with spectrograms and spectra (second page) that there is a slight increase in DARM noise for both X and Y injections mainly below 60 Hz. I turned the injections on and off multiple times because the noise is pretty subtle. I think we should further study these potential scattering issues after the break.

We do plan to get a clean set of TFs in a few days when things have stabilized. -- notes for next steps thanks to Sheila for this -- We plan to leave the SR3 overall yaw damping gain at -0.5.

We were cleared to go into Observing by the CAL team 45 minutes ago when we were still Locked and got in 10 minutes of Observation time before losing lock from an FSS oscillation . Before that troubleshooting was being done by the calibration team for the entirety of my shift so I had just been trying to keep us locked and by running broadband measurements when they needed them. Current status of the calibration work is that they tried multiple things with ultimately no success. The things they tried have been reverted and they will be writing up their own alog and continuing work on Monday. While trying to relock after the first lockloss of my shift and this last lockloss we got stuck in READY due to IMC_LOCK being in FAULT with the DIAG_MAIN messages: "" PSL_FSS: PZT MON is high may be oscillating "" and "" PSL_FSS_TPD: RefCav transmission low fix alignment "". I tried taking the IMC to DOWN and then back to LOCKED and tried toggling the FSS loop automation OFF and then back ON but neither seemed to help. But both times the IMC was eventually able to lock but I'm not sure that it had anything to do with my toggling. Once the IMC was locked relocking went smoothly for that first relock and so far is going well this relock. So the FSS oscillations are not only causing locklosses but now are also starting to delay relocking.

Specifically I used a 21 Hz - 25 Hz blrms of auxiliary channels (CS/EX/EY HPIISIPEM & SUS channels) to try and model a strain blrms of the same frequency via lasso. In the pdf attached the first slide shows the fit from running lasso. The r^2 value was pretty low but the lasso fit does pick up some peaks in the auxiliary channels that do line up with the strain noise. In the following slides I made time series plots of the channels that lasso found to be contributing the most to the re-creation of the strain. The results are a bit hard to interpret though. There seems to be roughly 5 peaks in the aux channel blrms but only 2 major ones in the strain blrms. The top contributing aux channels are also not really from one area so I can't say that this narrowed down a potential location. However two HAM8 channels were among the top contributors (H1:ISI_HAM8_BLND_GS_X/Y). It is hard to say if that is significant or not since I am only looking at about an hours worth of data. I did a rough check on the summary pages to see if this noise happened on more than one day but at this moment I didn't find other days with this behavior. If I do come across it happening again (or if someone else notices it) I can run lasso again.

I was only able to get a small improvement by walking the steering mirrors into the pump fiber and also a small decrease in the rejected polarization in HAM7 by walking the half wave plate and quarter wave plate in the pump fiber path. The attached trend shows that since the OFI ventthe green power reflected from the OPO in both polarizations has been steadily increasing while the transmitted power has been constant which means that the launched power has had to increase. This indicates that we should try to move the OPO crystal soon.

This required also re-tuning the OPO TEC setpoint ( which is the SDF you have accepted ) and re-ran SCAN_SQZANG to optimize squeezing with this lower squeezing level probably the to-do for SQZ is re-optimize fiber coupling into the pump fiber.

After trying a couple of controllers it was clear that the pump broke down.Shortly after the maintenance period because of the high seismic activity locking was impossible so the vacuum team took the opportunity and swapped the pump (as normally it would have been impossible during the 4 hours of the maintenance period).The AIP was swapped with a noble diode pump - this was not exactly intentional but turned out to be a happy accident as it seemingly works much better than the Starcell or even the Galaxy pumps. However as the noble diode pump has positive polarity a positive polarity controller was needed: the only available piece is an Agilent IPC Mini (see it in the picture attached) which works well but in the MEDM screen it appears to be faulty due to its wiring differences.All in all the HAM1/HAM2 twin-annulus system was pumped with the 2 AIPs and an Aux cart - Turbo pump bundle. The noble diode pump stabilized very nicely (at 5-7E-7 Torr which is unusually low) so eventually the Aux cart Turbo pump bundle was switched off - at 6:55 pm PT.Since then the 2 AIPs continue to decrease the annulus pressure which is indeed very nice so practically we are back to normal.In the meantime Gerardo quickly modified an appropriate Varian controller to have positive polarity so at the next opportunity the vacuum team will swap it with the Agilent controller so the MEDM screen will also be normal. Note that the Aux cart - Turbo bundle remain there until this swap happens. ,"{'term': 'LHO VE', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80411,janos.csizmazia@ligo.org

Oberling R. Short M. Pirello F. Clara F. Mera Summary : We're pretty much back where we started not sure where the problem is but sure there is a problem somewhere. Since mid-September there have been an increasing number of glitches in the FSS. These are seen in the FAST channel (signal to NPRO PZT) the PC channel (signal to phase-correcting EOM) and the TEMP channel (NPRO crystal operating temperature). In addition these glitches are the suspected cause of many locklosses in the last couple of weeks and have delayed relocking due to these glitches causing FSS oscillations. In light of this we took a look at the FSS today. At the start of maintenance we unlocked the IMC leaving the FSS locked to only the Reference Cavity (RefCav). I tweaked up the alignment then went out on the floor with Fernando and Ryan to take a look at the FSS transfer function. I set up the Agilent network analyzer as normal but the TF looked like garbage I had to up the source power to 0 dBm (from our usual -20 dBm) to get a clear signal and still the TF looked wrong. See first attachment. Seeing this we filed a WP ( 12114 ) and pulled the TTFSS box from the PSL enclosure and took it to the EE shop. The current TTFSS is old and we were unable to find a test plan for it. With Marc Fil and Fernando we began stepping through the circuit diagram testing each component to make sure it was functioning as expected from the diagram (for example: ""The gain should be x is it? No but we might be injecting too high a frequency see the filter in the feedback? Lower the frequency now is the gain OK? Yes.""). This was somewhat time consuming but we could find no single component that was clearly bad or not operating properly. Visually everything looked ok nothing was obviously blown or damaged. Marc did clean some excess flux from some of the solder pads. We then checked the LO and everything looked OK there as well signal amplitude might be a little high but Fil didn't see anything worrisome. Not knowing what else to do I reinstalled the TTFSS box. Once the box was installed I took a TF this time from inside the enclosure using the Agilent unit we keep in there. The TF looked just fine and as expected see 2nd attachment. With a common gain of 15 and a fast gain of 9 the FSS has a UGF of 452 kHz with 65° of phase margin the peaks around 770 kHz are still present like normal. We decided to check the crossover (where the NPRO PZT and the phase-correcting EOM meet) at ~20 kHz (this is set with the fast gain). The 3rd attachment shows the crossover as found with a fast gain of 9. We tried raising the fast gain but this made the crossover peak larger. Lowering the fast gain made the peak smaller but also starts to raise the overall signal (see 4th and 5th attachments with a fast gain of 7 and 6 respectively). We decided to leave the fast gain at 7 for now will see how things behave (in the 3 hours since we made this change and the time of writing this alog behavior seems unchanged). The picture with the fast gain at 7 does looke a little worse than the intial one with fast gain at 9 not sure why we went back and forth between them a couple times and 9 looked worse than 7 each time (maybe I got ""lucky"" with the camera shot?). This done we transitioned the enclosure back to Science Mode. Before leaving the LVEA we tried one more thing. Since we had a successful TF measurement inside the enclosure we hooked up the Agilent unit by the PSL/ISC racks again and took a TF (since I had an apparent junk measurement with this same unit earlier in the day see that 1st attachment again). The TF looked perfectly fine matched the measurement done inside the enclosure. Not sure where the garbage TF from this morning came from at this point I can only call it ""user error of unknown origin."" So we've ended where we started sure there's a problem but not sure where it is. The current TTFSS appears to be operating correctly but the FAST signal is still glitching we even saw glitching with the IMC unlocked although Ryan reports that it ""seems"" like the glitching is more frequent when the IMC is locked (maybe IFO feedback is exacerbating an existing issue...). Marc and Fil have been testing a newer gen of TTFSS (not the same as used in SQZ as that one is not compatible with the PSL as currently wired) so once that is qualified we will try switching to it (Peter King had it working with the RefCav in the optics lab so it should work with the PSL). We'll try that next. ","{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80409,jason.oberling@ligo.org

The error reported over the weekend using the PCAL monitoring lines suggests that LHO is well within the 10% magnitude & 10 degree error window after about 15 minutes into each lock ( attached image ). Here is a link to the 'monitoring line' grafana page that we often look at to keep track of the PCALY/GDS_CALIB_STRAIN response at the monitoring line frequencies. The link covers Saturday to today. This still suggests the presence of calibration error near 33Hz that is not currently understood but as mentioned earlier it's now well within the 10%/10deg window. We think that the SRCL offset adjustment in LHO:80334 and LHO:80331 accounts for the largest contribution to the improvement of the calibration at LHO in the past week. -- What's Been Tried --No attempts by CAL (me JoeB Vlad) to correct the 33Hz error have been successful. Many things were tried throughout the week (mostly on Tuesday & Friday) that went without being properly logged. Here's a non-exhaustive list of checks we've tried (in no particular order): We cross-checked every single front end filter and gain parameter in the pyDARM model file against what's installed at LHO. Other than non-impacting foton file changes (e.g. out-of-path module changes) the only mismatch we identified is that the bias voltage in pyDARM was set to 3.3 instead of the IFO's 3.25 . We quickly implemented SRC detuning by copying the LLO setup. I did this by making on-the-fly changes to pyDARM on a local copy of the repo. I'll have to follow up with what these exact adjustments entailed. This seemed to do what we expected but it did not significantly impact the large 33Hz error. Some GDS pipeline-affecting parameters made their way into the pydarm ini at LHO. These changes were made around the time of the Cal F2F over the summer. I reverted them regenerated GSTLAL filters and installed them in the GDS pipeline. This didn't help. The commits in question are d2bfe349 8717a9f5 and dc7208e0 . We don't believe the delays being reported by the pyDARM fits of the actuation delay on the PUM stage. We made adjustments to the fitting parameters for this stage to increase the fit range to roughly 400Hz in the hopes that pyDARM would produce a somewhat believable number. More details on this item as time allows we are going to tune our injections to reduce uncertainty on these measurements in particular. This tuning will need to be done in tandem with other tunings (e.g. reducing PCAL at low frequencies to avoid leakage from polluting simultaneous higher frequency measurements). We made similar adjustments to the sensing fit parameters. We extended the low end of the fit range to better capture the detuning near 10Hz in the fit. Once it approached midnight on Friday night we reverted everything and left the IFO back in the state we found it in. This process is also not straightforward and requires creating a new 'fake' pyDARM report each time due recently-discovered bugs in the pyDARM infrastructure. This bug is being tracked here . --What Changed?--We think the SRC change(s) on September 5 ( LHO:79929 also discussed in LHO:79903 ) line up well with the time frame at which the 33Hz error issue popped up. Here is a screenshot showing that the 33Hz error showed up on September 5. I've also attached a shot of ndscope showing the SRCL offset change on 09/05 from -175cts to -290cts here . cal_better_after_srcl_changed.png shows the error tracked by the monitoring lines before and after the SRCL offset was changed back to -190cts.

While this process was happening over the course of several milliseconds the lockloss occurred. Indeed it seems the drive to the ISS AOM and the secondloop output suddenly dropped right before the first loop opened but I don't notice a significant change in the diffracted power at this time (see attached screenshot).

Frequent glitches cause the drive to keep rising (see 7min screenshot ) Glitches are (probably) too fast to be responses of suspensions moving and changing cavity length SUS not seen moving during these times Glitches happen while locked although usually with lower frequency (see screenshot ) Sometimes after lockloss glitches can persist and cause actual oscillations delaying IMC (and IFO) relocking time as the FSS is not ready see screenshot from last week Non FSS_OSCILLATION tagged lockloss example: see screenshot Please feel free to add comments of anything else anyone finds.

There wasn’t really much noise in DARM that was present at the X arm manifold. More noise can be seen on the Y arm but it seems like it is less than the end stations. First Valera and I tried shaking the Manifold with both shaker and human injections at 0.3 Hz. This produced nothing in DARM. We also tried to bang on and push/pull the tube around the manifold. This produced a resonant peak near 100 Hz but nothing like the microseism scatter noise we were hunting or the noise recently found at the X end . ( See 0.3 Hz tests plots ) I then performed a 1-3 Hz Sweep a 3-10 Hz Sweep a 5.43 Hz line 8.75 Hz line and a 21.43 Hz line. These tests replicate what we performed on the X manifold. For the Y-arm shaking I might have been too aggressive with the gain for the sweeps as some harmonics were present. These harmonics can come from the shaker connection to the tube if it is loose but the connection seemed good when Valera and I were out on the floor so maybe I just was shaking a little too hard. Despite the harmonics I believe that the noise found in our shakes still supports that the manifold scattering is largest at the End Stations followed by the CS Y manifold and then the CS X manifold. 1-3 Hz sweep showed up in the 60-100 Hz DARM BLRMS but was hard to pick out in a DARM Spectogram. ( SEE 1-3 Hz plots ) 3-10 Hz also elevated the 60-100 Hz DARM BLRMS and showed some noise in DARM but less than was seen for the End Station Sweeps . Of particular note are the two bumps in the DARM BLRMS around 7 and 8 Hz. ( SEE 3-10 Hz plots ). Each line injection in DARM produced somewhat similar noise in DARM as each other. The 8.75 Hz injection was to try and match where the excess noise was present in the sweep.

Here are two sets of instructions one that can be used while in observing to adjust this and one that can be done when we loose lock or are out of observing for some other reason. For these first few days please follow the out of observing instructions when relocking if this hasn't been done in the last few hours and please try to do it in the last few hours of the evening shift so that the temperature is close to well tuned at the start of the owl shift. Out of observing instructions (to be done while recovering from a lockloss can be done while ISC_LOCK is locking the IFO) ( screenshot ) : Make sure that ISC_LOCK will not set SQZ_MANAGER request to INJECT_SQZ by setting the request to ADS_TO_CAMERAs or any lower state. From sitemap SQZ_OVERVIEW set SQZ MANGER request to LOCKED_SEED_NLG. from the purple !SQZ scopes button open the NLG scope Once the SQZ manger is in LOCKED_SEED_NLG you should see that the red OPO_IR_TRANS trace on the scope is oscillating. Adjust the OPO temperature using the slider which is right under the purple SQZ scopes button to maximize the peak of the oscillations. SET_SQZ MANGER request back to FDS_READY_IFO and once that's ready you can set the ISC_LOCK request to nominal low noise. Before going to observing you can adjust the squeezing angle by requesting SQZ_MANAGER to SCAN_SQZANG. It is best practice to do this after the IFO has thermalized but it can be done early in the lock. If lock stretches are long and this has been done only early in the lock it may need adjusting for a thermalized IFO . Right now the squeezing angle has a strong frequency dependence early in the lock stretch so let's not adjust it until the IFO has been locked for at least an hour. In observing instructions: Both the OPO temperature and the SQZ phase are ignored in SDF and can be adjusted while we are in observing but it's important to log the times of any adjustments made. To adjust the temperature in full lock go to the purple SQZ_SCOPE button and choose the OPO temp scope adjust the OPO temperature to maximize CLF_REFL_RF6_ABS (the green trace). After doing this it might be necessary to adjust the SQZ PHASE which can be adjusted in steps of 5 degrees or so. Set this to maximize the squeezing level which you can do by watching the DARM FDS dtt template. It is available from the SQZ DTT purple button or on NUC33. It is easiest to adjust this for high frequency squeezing (around 1kHz) this should get you close to good squeezing at 100 Hz. Changes made to make this easier (Thanks Corey for beta testing the instructions): I've commented out the request to SQZ_MANGER that ISC_LOCK makes in low noise length control because that took control of the squeezer from Corey when he was giving these instructions a trial. The OPO temp is not monitored in SDF I removed the goto= True from the LOCK_FSS state. This will force SQZ_MANAGER to go through down after the NLG measurement (and turn off the seed PZT ramp).

Then there is a larger glitch that happened about 1 second before lockloss where POP18 drops below the trigger threshold and the DRMI guardian goes to DOWN at the same time the ALS Y arm looses green lock which then unlocks the ALS X arm. This glitch doesn't seem to be cause by the DRMI ASC although we were in the process of engaging that ASC when it happened. It also isn't due to the BS ISI isolation coming on which hadn't happened yet. Edit: I looked into a second lockloss from PRMI: 1412095134 this one is different in that it happens very quickly and PRMI and ALS signals drop out at close to the same time.

WP 12116 12117 . Last done in October 2023: 73524 . Followed instructions from 73524 65684 with additional notes below. Took SQZT7 area to local laser hazard and plugged straight into the OPO_IR_PD for our red signal and the OPO_TRANS PD for our green signal. Trying to take the signals from the outside of the table or the SQZ racks was confusing. Setup: Old style function generator offset 4.5V for a 1-9V scan at 10Hz. Oscilloscope and long BNCs/adapters: plug into function generator OPO_IR_PD and the OPO_TRANS photodetectors inside SQZT7. PZT driver MDT694 which has 0-150V output for 0-10V input connected this to the PZT1 connector in the back of the chassis using the adapter for PZT2 (note this means that the PZT2 offset we had been keeping at +10V was 0V for this measurements controlled by CLF SLOWOUTOFS 65535 ). Wincam dell laptop and gray E-870 PI shift driver box (stored in LVEA SQZ cabinet) and the OPO crystal cable remains attached +X HAM7 flange. What we did: After set up once we could see both mode scans on the oscilloscope we injected the seed beam and reduced green power from 30mW to 6mW to avoid pumping too much. Pico wasn't working: 80449 . Adjusted temperature to get red and green co-resonance. Plot attached of before spot move. In alog 73524 we used the OPO spot 2nd from the left. We moved (32 x 50 steps to right then 2 x 10 steps to right) to the next spot with a red-green co-resonance 3rd from the left. Plot attached. Increased the green power back to 25mW then 30mW and then things got confusing: we were seeing rapidly changing strange signals and negatives on OPO_TRANS channel. Beckhoff version of the channels looked better. We eventually found that the whitening filters must have been saturating and giving us strange signals. We increased SHG ISS drivepoint to 10V allowing us to use a lower green pump this showed that the high green pump was our issues. Then reduced the SHG power to 14mW while the SHG ISS drivepoint was in the middle of the range at 5V. When the ISS was engaged it could keep the opo_grTrans_setpiont_uW to 80uW with the controlmon around 6 and SHG_LAUNCH ~11.5mW. This is much less than the 30mW we needed this morning so this new crystal spot is much less lossy. OPO started to oscillate when we locked it so we reduced the OPO gain from -4 to -8 and accepted in sdf. Sheila set the opo_grTrans_setpiont_uW to 80uW in sqzparams.py and we measured the NLG to be 11 (Amplified / Un-amplified = 0.098/0.0089 see 76542 ). Ran SCAN_SQZ_ALGNMENT and SCAN_SQZ_ANG. This gave us >4dB of squeezing at high frequency. We left PZT2 (CLF SLOWOUTOFS) at 0V see 80450 . Today 75uW OPO trans power corresponded to 0.945 on the OPO refl diode last night that was 4.161mW on OPO refl diode. Meaning after this spot move we now need to inject a lot less power into the OPO to get the same output power. ,"{'term': 'H1 SQZ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80451,camilla.compton@ligo.org

We then went to no squeezing and set the offset back to it's nominal value and saw reduced squeezing when we reinjected squeezing. We could recover the better squeezing level by slowly stepping this offset back to 0V. We think that this could be because the PZT setting changes the alignment of the OPO and the squeezed beam coming out of it. (which also changes the squeezing angle). A similar effect was seen with PZT1 in 80396 and 78529 . It would be interesting another time to try changing this offset and seeing if we can recover squeezing by readjusting alignment and squeezing angle.,"{'term': 'H1 SQZ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80450,sheila.dwyer@ligo.org

There was some trial and error here mainly due to the difficulty in matching the phase as well as the rising gain of the transfer function above 100 Hz which you can see in this plot . This results in the best fit having some high Q pole just above 250 Hz and of course the usual struggle to keep the gain low below 10 Hz. I found better results when I limited the gain between 1 and 10 Hz to a maximum of 0.5 and also reduced my fit range to go between 10 and 60 Hz which is where the sensitivity improvement is required and then limited the gain from 100-1000 Hz to 0.02. PRCL is limiting the noise up to 30 Hz and far below th noise floor around 100 Hz so it's probably ok to keep the PRCL noise the same or just slightly worse above 60 Hz ( NB alog ). Finally with Gabriele's help I found a fit that worked! Here is the injection comparison with no feedforward and the new feedforward. I updated the DARM traces so you can see that the PRCL contribution to DARM is slightly worse around 100 Hz but much better up to 60 Hz by up to a factor of 10. The new filter is in FM7 (I have triple checked this!) and I have added it to the guardian and SDFed this in observe ( screenshot ). I did some chopping of the PRCL FF to check the improvement in DARM see plot . I think there is improvement between 20-30 Hz but it's hard to tell. I set out to rerun the noise budget injection of PRCL so we could remake the plots but there was a lockloss while I was measuring (I think because people were on the floor?). I don't think the lockloss was from the NB injection. ","{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80445,elenna.capote@ligo.org

Summary Of The Last 2-Years (Alphabetical list of people who have helped/been involved: C.Gray J.Kissel R.McCarthy J.Oberling T.Sadecki R.Savage TJ Shaffer R.Short B.Weaver) Upgrade To 200W Laser (Fall 2022) Until recently the last batch of Pulled Fibers were pulled in Fall 2022. At this time the Fiber Puller started having issues related to the laser ( f100 CO2 laser by Synrad 100W and 10600um)--this laser was well over a dozen years old and at the end of its operational life. Higher power lasers had already been purchased for the Fiber Puller about 5-years ago in preparation for an upgrade and a possible need to pull thicker diameter silica fibers for heavier suspensions. Because of this it was decided to upgrade the Fiber Puller with one of these 200W lasers ( f201 CO2 laser by Synrad 200W and 10600um). The 200W laser is bigger than the previous laser and because of this the back of this laser hangs off the edge of the optics table but Rick made a nice breadboard which offers a platform to support the back of this laser (see image1) . Cabinets and furniture were removed along the wall to allow extra space to for walking around this area of the lab. After RyanS and I installed the new laser & re-did the chiller plumbing we moved on to aligning the laser into the Fiber Puller. Since alignment work was next we took this opportunity to swap in new upper & lower conical mirrors in the Fiber Puller (Travis ordered these a while ago.). Alignment Work Begins (2023-2024) Then with the help of Karl Toland's thesis (Chapter 2) we started Fiber Puller alignment. This included Mechanical checks of the Fiber Puller which looked mostly OK it was noticed there is a slight tilt forward of the tower. We decided to not change this. The periscope which points the beam into the Fiber Puller was reconfigured to allow its translation stages (namely the horizontal one) to have better adjustability for pointing into the Fiber Puller--previously the horizontal translation stage only moved forward and back which did not allow for horizontal translations of the beam into the Fiber Puller (this only required us to rotate the translation stage 90deg). After this it was all optical alignment work and this proved to be non-trivial. Additionally one of the gold mirrors was burned. This mirror had a glass substrate so it was replaced with a gold mirror with a copper substrate (also took this opportunity to replace several dirty input gold mirrors). Then there was several months of no progress with alignment. Eventually Travis & Jason checked out the status of alignment. And in Aug 2024 Jason was able to give us a decent looking beam on our stock and after almost 2-years fibers were finally pulled again! Return To Fiber Pulling! ...For A Little While. Between Aug 2-20th six fibers were pulled (4 passes & 2 fails). At this point while preparing to pull another fiber one of the 1/8"" ID tubing to the shutter burst on Aug 20 2024. NOTE: Here I will paste in the email summary I sent to the group on Sept 26th. Recovery From The Plumbing Failure On Aug 20 2024 [start of email] Summary : After the 1/8"" chilling hose burst (8/20) weeks were spent with recovery and buying new plumbing hardware. There is now better hosing for the shutter + beam bender (mirror mount) and most of the fittings have been replaced with push-to-connects (excepted for barbed fitting of the beam bender (see image 6) ). We have been running the chiller w/ new plumbing since 9/17/2024. For the plumbing fix above this was done in-situ without removing the shutter or mirror mount with the hopes of preserving the alignment but first looks at alignment by myself and Jason at separate times did see an alignment change on our fiber stock target. On Sept 25th we were both able to work on the Fiber Puller and Jason was able to get us a decent alignment back we pulled our first fiber since the 8/20 chiller plumbing link---and this fiber also passed on 9/26! PLUMBING (see image 5) : The backstory is years ago a water-cooled shutter & mirror mount were installed (1/8"" ID plumbing using a mix of push-to-connect & barbed fittings) for the Fiber Puller. The water-cooled shutter & mirror mount were added in series to the laser (which has 1/2""OD tubing) via an aluminum manifold. During the 100W to 200W laser swap by RyanS and I we discovered everything downstream of the laser (1/8"" ID stuff) had been clogged (most likely for years) from the manifold downstream to the shutter + mirror mount. This led to us replacing all lines cleaning the manifold and starting to use OptiShield with the chiller water with hopes of preventing any corrosion clogs. This worked for a while during the upgrade and even through six NEW fibers pulled in August but after the 6 th fiber there was a huge burst in the tubing at the shutter. This led to repair work with a few issues/notes observed: Non-Water Tubing FAIL : The line which failed (I reordered what was originally installed) was very bendy and easy to work with. BUT over several purchase orders it was noticed that this line was rated for ""air"" use. This led to being more mindful of types of tubing. Firstly making sure we had (1) water-rated tubing and also (2) tubing with decent max-pressure ratings. Perhaps overkill but ultimately went with tubing with max pressure rating of 120psi. This new tubing was definitely much stiffer than the previous tubing. Metric & Inch : Previously--between the manifold shutter and beam-bender we had a mix of different fitting connections. Additionally because we were looking for: water-rated high max-pressure rating consistent fittings etc it limited options. Ultimately went with metric tubing + push-to-connect fittings (see image 4) . Able to make this change for everything except for the mirror mount ( it remained with its barbed fittings but it has 3 barbs and it feels like a good connection ). Additionally our pressures are pretty low (under 50psi)---not measured for the new 6mm lines but the chiller's pressure dial reads ~25psi for the system . 90deg Elbow Fittings Under Shutter (see images 2 & 3) : When the group checked out this plumbing work a few weeks ago TJ suggested elbow fittings under the shutter (mainly because this is where the previous tubing burst and the lines do take a bit of bend under the shutter here). New push-to-connect elbows were added. Pressure/Flow values & Adding Sensors : Had not really paid attention to what the pressure & flow of the system are through all this work but after the failure it was brought up by Travis and Jason. We have a Flow sensor on the supply line ( downriver from the laser) and a pressure gauge (also on supply side at the chiller). Just for a rough idea of numbers here are values observed: Flow sensor: this ran at 1.0gpm with just the laser but after the new 6mmOD system was added it's increased to 2.0gpm Pressure gauge: was running around 30psi at some points during the rework (more consistently at 26psi after the new 6mmOD system added) TO DO list: More Sensors! Would be nice to add more flow/pressure sensors at more points in the plumbing system--especially for the 6mmOD lines. With focus on getting operation back I did not get a chance to look into ordering this but we should do this at some point. ALIGNMENT Once Again : For all of the plumbing work above I opted to do it ""in situ"" by not ""touching"" the shutter or beam bender (I did not remove them from the beam path and only connected/disconnected their tubing)---this was all in the hopes of not changing the alignment---we had a nice alignment which produced decent fibers in August! Although I attempted to be careful with all of the plumbing work above first checks by both myself and Jason later showed we were off a little when we looked at the fiber stock target with the red beam. [On Sept 25 2024] Jason and I were both able to work together in the fiber lab. Here are some of the notes I took while Jason did his alignment magic! Coalignment of shutter's red beam with the main CO2 beam : It looked decent via a check of the co-alignment-beam-check path (via flipper mirror) that Jason and RyanS added earlier this summer. We made an ever-so-slightly small change via the shutter red-beam adjustment screws. Alignment Attempt #1 : Red beam alignment Jason went through alignment touch-up via the periscope mirrors. He was quickly able to get a decent beam on the fiber stock target. At this point he checked to see how this beam looked with the alignment irises which have been in place all the while (between the periscope and Fiber Puller). After aligning beam to the irises he once again had a decent beam on the fiber stock. In both cases there was a ""hot spot"" noted on the ""back"" side of the fiber stock. CO2 beam alignment With the main CO2 beam on a new fiber stock we needed to turn the power up to about 55-60% on the laser to be able to see the beam via the cameras in the Labview app. With the cameras I tweaked the (periscope mirrors) to get a better alignment (which allowed us to lower the power to about 50%). Jason had a try at tweaking alignment via the cameras (I believe this was his first chance getting to do this—especially since the side camera was better-focused on our stock back in August). We were able to optimize a little more but it still looked not great (see image 7) . I thought it might have looked like what we had when we were pulling fibers in August but we could clearly see it wasn't great. There was an angle on the fiber stock and the rear camera could clearly see the angle even more. I mentioned we could probably pull a fiber but we'd definitely have to increase the laser power. We did not pull a fiber however. We broke for lunch with hopes at more checks in the afternoon. Alignment Attempt #2 With Mechanical Offset Check Between Top & Bottom Clamp Translation Stages : Translation Stages : Thinking there was still something amiss mechanically Jason wanted to check the Top & Bottom Clamp Translation Stages. We do this using a special tool to set the Upper translation stage and the Lower translation stage (the latter we have not touched for a while). Jason went through several iterations of making small adjustments to both the upper and lower translation stages (see image 8) . On one of the final adjustments he intentionally overshot the upper translation stages. This was to hopefully help us later (it did!). Tower : NOTE: At this point Jason continued with mechanical checks and we looked at the Tower with a bubble level. There is an observable tilt forward of the tower albeit small. (this is mentioned above) Karl's thesis mentions this should be fixed but there are no tolerances given or go/no go values. And it's not clear how to do this without a major change to the system. There are alot of surface-to-surface mechanical contacts in the tower so one would need to loosen lots of bolts and then possibly install shims and retorque down everything. Anyway---a big job. Since it is a small tilt we are just noting it and decided to move on. In the future the Fiber Puller will need to be upgraded to a taller tower this will definitely give us the opportunity to remove the tilt from the tower (note: This could be a reason for [the known years-long issue of ] why we always have to make adjustments to the upper clamp translation stage almost every time we pull a fiber). Red beam alignment Once again Jason very quickly went through an alignment onto our fiber stock. One nice thing: no ""hot spot"" on back side of stock! CO2 beam alignment A new stock was installed and we heated it. We could clearly see the beam with the cameras at a lower power of 45%! (lower power than Attempt #1! Our 1st good sign!) And the 2nd good signs was the forward & back alignment of the stock was GOOD (in other words there was not an offset in this direction! Another sign the translation stage mechanical checks did us good!). The stock did show an offset in the other direction (""left/right"") so the translation stage was adjusted accordingly. Additionally the spot on the stock looked MUCH better on the cameras (3rd good sign! [see image 9] ). There were minimal angles seen with the ""ring spot"" on the stock! Touched up the alignment a little more but it was already better than how we looked in the morning. We were ready to pull! Vaporization Before pulling wanted to get an idea of what laser power we could go up to before silica vaporization begins. Ryan can correct me here but I believe Alan told us we should do pulls at laser powers just lower than the laser power when silica vaporization occurs. The laser power was slowly ramped up and I started seeing vaporization somewhere around 75-80% (it was very bright on the stock). Polish & Pull Not sure of what is the ideal values to use here but to just do it went with: Polish power = 55.5% Pull power = 65.0% Although late in the afternoon we went through the whole process. Fiber was profiled and then analyzed: PASSED! It had a bit of a low fundamental = 493.892 Hz This is where we ended for that day. Have continued to pull more fibers and get more data points with an eye on the fundamental (violin) mode frequencies. One knob we have here are those Polish & Pull powers. NOTE: A reminder that even with the 100W laser toward the end our fibers have been populating the lower range of violin mode frequencies (see fiber table ). Something to think about. Additional Note On Alignment & Power With our nice alignment it should also be noted we are still running at higher powers than what we are used to (which was at 85% or ~85W with the 100W). With the current 200W laser we were running at ~140W in Aug for pulls and yesterday we were at ~135W. This would point to a the overall alignment in need of some improvement.

This FSS issue seems to be having a serious impact on our duty cycle. I had a helpful conversation with Rick this afternoon about this issue he sugested that we trying looking for the glitches in other places in the PSL so that we could think about tests where we don't run some of the feedback servos and see if we still see the issue. I made an ndscope template with all the PSL fast channels I could find it is saved in sheila.dwyer/ndscope/PSL/PSL_fast_channels.yaml Looking at 1412111658 with this scope it looks like several of these channels that we are saving at a fast rate might not be connected for example the OSC and HPL channels are around 0. The only other channel that clearly shows these glitches is H1:PSL-PWR_NPRO_OUT_DQ. Request for operators: If you are having locking difficulties over the weekend it may be due to the PSL/FSS problems. To help narrow down the cause of the problem one could sit for an hour or two with the FSS unlocked and the ISS unlocked. If the glitches show up in the NPRO channel even without these servos locked then we will know that the problem is not from the FSS but from the NPRO.

I went through the noise budget code and found that these plots were made without median averaging. However changing the code to use median averaging is a simple matter of uncommenting one line of code in /ligo/gitcommon/NoiseBudget/aligoNB/aligoNB/common/utils.py that governs how the PSD is calculated for the noise budget. I reran the darm_integral_compare code using median averaging. The result shows much less difference in the noise at low frequency between these two times. The range is still improved from 10-50 Hz but there is a small drop in the range between 50-60 Hz. I still think the change from 10-30 Hz is likely due to PRCL. ,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80538,elenna.capote@ligo.org

Based on the previous noise budget measurements and the change in the coherence of PRCL from Sept 28 to Oct 5 I think the improvement in DARM from 10-30 Hz is likely due to the PRCL improvement.

New SQZ ASC using AS42 signals with feedback to ZM4 and ZM6 tested and implemented. We still need to watch that this can keep a good SQZ alignment during thermalization. In O4a we used a SQZ ASC with ZM5/6 we have not had a SQZ ASC for the majority of O4b. Prep to improve SQZ: No squeezing from 15:31:30 to 15:41:30UTC. Adjusted OPO temperature following no observing instructions in 80461 . Measured NLG to be 12.8. (0.1165/0.0091) following 76542 . This improved the squeezing from 2.5dB above 300Hz to 3dB at 300Hz and 4.2bD above 1kHz. Testing ASC from 80373 : Ran the ""reset as42 nosqz"" offsets script while in no sqz. SDF accepted. Put the input matrices form 80373 into SQZ ASC and checked they were diagonalized correctly by moving ZM4/6 in turn and watching ASC_POZ/ANG input signals. ZM4 pitch wasn't completely diagonalized but that others looked good. Reduced ASC_WFS gain from 0.1 to 0.05 cleared histories set all ASC_POS/ANG gains to 1 and one at a time turned on the inputs. We had some troubleshooting with POS_Y but there was a minus sign inside one of the filter banks we hadn't seen. In this troubleshooting we found the matrix was mostly diagonal so removed the cross-coupling terms for the YAW input matrix. Found WFS gain is better with lower WFS gain to 0.01 so we took a factor of 100 for the input matrix and left H1:SQZ-ASC_WFS_GAIN at 0.5. Accepted all in sdf. And edited sqzparams and reloaded SQZ_MANAGERT to turn on SQZ ASC. To test we tried the ""offload AS42 ASC"" script with the plan to compare the AS42 alignment with the alignment from the guardians scan SQZ alignment. The script didn't work as expected it's hard-coded to offload ZM45/6 rather than ZM4/6 that we are now using we should fix this or go back to using ther guardian states.

We suspected coupling at HAM1 and I tested this recently using local injections and the beating shaker technique. With local injections at HAM1 using shakers and HEPI we can produce much larger signals at the HAM1 table top then at the PSL or HAM2. The coupling site will likely have the same ratio of locally injected peaks to distant equipment peaks in its vibration sensors as the ratio of these peaks in DARM. The figure shows that the ratio of the injected peak at 25 Hz to the Air Handler peak at 26.35 Hz is consistent with coupling at HAM1 but not HAM2 (or any place else – most other potential coupling sites don’t even detect the peak injected locally at HAM1) The figure also shows that the beats from the beating shakers matched DARM at the HAM1 table top but could also be consistent with coupling at HAM2 so this technique as implemented gave a consistency check but did not discrimate well between HAM1 and 2.

The figure shows that scattering noise continues to be quite sensitive to the CP yaw on a 20 microradian scale. While re-checks did not previously suggest the need for a change after the initial setting ( 76969 ) the figure shows that this time the check suggests a new setting. The original setting -250 is now in a coupling peak. I suggest changing it to -325 (see figure). The second page of the figure shows that the coupling peaks are very repeatable.

BOSEM drift trends were reported in LLO aLOG entry 73180 . Initially we debugged a failure to actuate on the M1 SIDE channel for which swapping the BOSEM resolved the fault (replacement BOSEM S1900661). We measured BOSEM open-lights for the SIDE channel calculated gains and offsets and then centered the flag.We manually took DTT undamped TFs on the BBSS and then exported to Matlab.See 2024-10-07_1400_X2SUSBS_M1_ALL_TFs below for the first X2 (LLO) BBSS measurement.This has been compared with a measurement made at X1 (LHO) below. The plot key is as follows:-Blue Trace = Model (bbssopt).Orange Trace = X1 BS M1 (2024-08-30_2300). M1 LHO *net* blade heights average out to d1 = -1.5mmMagenta Trace = X2 BS M1 (2024-10-07_1400). M1 1st LLO measurement blade heights average out to d1 = -2.0mmTFs are looking fairly consistent between the sites and I believe we plan to change the d1 and remeasure. EDIT: Quick summary as also noted by Jeff K there are what appear to be roll-modes cross-coupling into the vertical DoF TF which is not observed at LHO so this should be looked into.

29896,L1 ISC - Analysis of Individual TR ERM PDs During Loud Glitches,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=73447,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Mon, 07 Oct 2024 18:10:29 -0500",[Tabata Gaby] Summary: the ERM PDs ( alog 72968 ) have correlations with DARM during loud glitches and these correlations are in most cases only with the X arm or only with the Y arm. The signals of individual PDs increase during loud glitches consistent with 'dust' scattering light back to the ERM PDs and forward to DARM. According to the OmegaScan analysis in most cases at least three PDs are affected during a loud glitch In the alog 73024 we analyzed the coincidences of Loud Glitches with TR ERM PDs through the SUM channels (ASC-X_TR_ERM_NSUM_OUT_DQ/ASC-Y_TR_ERM_NSUM_OUT_DQ). Here we present a quick overview of the data for the four individual PDs (L1:ISC-X_TR_ERM_SEG*_OUT_DQ/L1:ISC-Y_TR_ERM_SEG*_OUT_DQ) available from September 17th ( alog 73135 ). For the analysis we selected the 200 loudest glitches from September 18 to September 30. The lowest SNR in this dataset was 182. - Looking at the raw normalized time series the amplitude of the signal in the PDs goes up in most cases. This indicates that if dust is causing this it is probably scattering the light rather than blocking it. Image 1 presents an example where PD1 (blue) and PD3 (salmon) show an increase in signal during the presence of a loud glitch in DARM (black). - Image 2 shows the SNR behavior (y-axis) for each PD in the Y arm for 100 glitches (x-axis). We can see that they go up and down together most of the time suggesting that most of the PDs witness the signal. Interestingly PD3 in the Y arm seems to have the highest SNR in most cases as well. - Figure 3 presents the correlation from OmegaScan for the SUM channels for each arm. This illustrates the fact that when there is a high correlation with the X arm there is a low correlation with the Y arm and vice versa. In the previous dataset ( alog 73024) the number of coincidences with the Y arm was very similar to those with the X arm however according to OmegaScan the PDs in the Y arm show more correlations in this dataset. - From the plot in Figure 3 we set a threshold for the correlation equal to 10. Based on this threshold we calculated the percentage of PDs that have correlations above 10. As illustrated in Figure 4 more than 75% of the analyzed loud glitches correlate with at least three PDs which aligns with the plot presented in Figure 3 . We will further investigate this dataset including an analysis of the delays among the affected individual PDs. In addition we will calculate the coherence to cross-check with OmegaScan.

The rationale is as follows:1. The lines that appear during this short test appear to be mostly comb-like but that is not completely understood. Further investigations with more data collected would be required in order to assess what other line contamination appears while temporary AC is on. In addition we'd need to reallocate our overworked/shallow pool of personnel in order to separately characterize this temporary configuration.2. Noise mitigation efforts take a range of possibilities: 2a. vetoing the entire time the temporary AC unit is on (the sledgehammer) is fairly straightforward but it would mean the complete loss of the usefulness of the data collected during this time. We would rather not have to take this approach 2b. vetoing artifacts that appear during this interval which basically means repeating the lines-list creation but just for this short stretch of time. Considering it has taken a significant effort for the O4a epoch and that we're already working on other lines of investigation we'd rather not have to separately assess the temporary AC unit on time 2c. line subtraction has been proposed but we are not convinced that noise subtraction means that the data is now no longer contaminated. Even subtraction by a factor of 1000 means that there could still be contamination (we see evidence of this for the calibration lines for example). Thus we do not regard line subtraction as a promised solution. In addition someone would need to carry out this (non-trivial) subtraction work.3. We advocate for additional efforts to reduce noise coupling before the data is contaminated and we have to take on the heavy burden to additionally characterize the time the temporary AC unit is on. If these are successful then we do not have to treat this time interval in any special way. Hopefully reducing noise coupling by a factor of 100 is enough for the CW group. I also want to raise the issue that the Vela pulsar signal is putatively at approximately 22 Hz. We do not want to raise the noise floor in this region at all because it is high-profile potential CW source.

After some finagling and calling Daniel he pointed me to check IMs and PRs and indeed IM4 and PR2 were off in P and Y so I trended those values and then set them to their original. We were able to Find IR complete initial alignment and went all the way up to NLN. Unable to SQZ: Was happy to finally get to NLN (2:07 UTC) but then the SQZ was unable to lock FC.

I plotted the last eight seconds before lockloss for the various lockloss times. This time I split up the times into different graphs based on if the DC2 max displacement from zero in the last second before lockloss was above 0.06 (based on the histogram in previous comment): Greater = the max displacement is greater than 0.06 Less = the max displacement is less than 0.06. However I discovered that some of the locklosses that are above 0.06 for the DC2 channel are failing the logic test in the code: getting considered as having a max displacement less than 0.06 and getting plotted on the lower plots. I wonder if this is also happening in the histograms but this would only mean that we are underestimating the number of locklosses above the threshold. This could be suppressing possible bimodal distributions for other histograms as well. (Looking into debugging this) I split the locklosses into 5groups of 8 and 1 group of 5 to make it easier to distinghuish between the lines in the plots.

Settings before we started: Laser diode A set temperature 18.3C Laser diode B set temperature 15.99C laser diode injection current 2.134 Amps laser crystal set temperature 26.04 C laser crystal actual temperature 26.10 C. We went to the diode room and followed the notes from the procedure Ryan Short outlined to me to shut down the amplifiers turning off amp2 then amp1 then closing the shutter then we went one step beyond his instructions and shut off the NPRO. We swapped the controller with all the cables including the interlock. When we powered on S2200008 laser diode A temperature was set to 17.14 B set to 22.96C. We adjusted the pots on the front panel until they matched the values we had written down from the original controller. We turned the knob on the front panel for the injection current to 0. Rick and I went to the laser diode room and turned the NPRO back on Keita confirmed that this turned on the controller. We noticed that the laser diode 1 and 2 set temps were what we had set them to be by adjusting the pots for A and B but the act temp readbacks weren't matching we confirmed with photos that with the original controller the set and actual temps matched. (I will attach a photo of this state). At the rack Ketia turned the injection current up to about 100mA this didn't change the temperature readbacks. We had a discussion with Matt Heinze who agreed this is probably a readback issue and that it was safe to keep going. We think that this is because we haven't adjusted the pots on the LIGO daughter board following T1900456 . Keita slowly turned up the injection current knob while Rick and I watched from the diode room the NPRO power came back to 1.8W which was the same as before. The laser diode act power readbacks for diode 1 says 3.6W while it was 5W with the original controller and diode 2 says 2.48W where it also said 5W with the original controller. Since the power output is the same we think these are also just readback problems due to not following T1900456 . We opened the shutter turned on the amplifiers after a few minutes and set the power watchdogs back on as well as the pump diode watchdog. The PMC and FSS locked without issue Daniel found that the squeezer laser frequency had to increase by 850MHz to get the squeezer TTFSS locked so we moved the NPRO temperature up on the FSS by about 0.3 K. After this the squeezer and ALS lasers locked easily and Oli relocked the IFO. The first attached photo is the NPRO screen on the beckhoff machine before the controller swap the second photo is after. While Oli was relocking we saw that there are still glitches both of the attached screenshots were taken while the IFO was in the engage ASC state. Seeing this and based on Camilla's observation that the locklosses started 80561 on the same day that we redistributed gains to increase range in the IMC servo board in 79998 we decided to revert the change which was intended to help us ride out earth quakes. Daniel points out that this makes some sense that it might help to ride out the earthquake if we limit the range available to the carm servo. We hope that this will help us to ride out the glitches better without loosing lock. Rick went back to the diode room and reset the watchdogs after the laser had been running for about 2 hours. ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80566,sheila.dwyer@ligo.org

We measured the distance from the top of the ALS table to the optics TR-M2 and ALS-M18 as accurately as possible without altering the alignment so the measurements may not be very precise and could be off by a few millimeters. Additionally we measured from the inside top of the ALS table not the outside.

The magnet/flag assemblies also need to be installed in the intermediate mass assembly D2000176-v5 . The parts for the Magnet/Flag assemblies are expected to arrive by Thursday October 10 2024. However these parts still need to go through C&B before we can install them in the intermediate mass assembly. The next step is to install the HDS blades before installing the bottom mass assembly. These blades were paired after deflection measurements at LLO. The results can be found in the HDS BLADE DEFLECTION MEASUREMENTS spreadsheet. We have received the necessary parts and hardware to proceed with the HDS dither mirror assembly (bottom mass). Over the next couple of weeks we will focus on these assemblies. Rest assured we will continue to make progress. A detailed description of the assembly process is available in the O5 HXDS Clean Assembly Notes T2300438 . The status of the fabrication QA and C&B status can be found at C2200203: HDS fabrication for O5 . More pictures can be found at O5 HXDS pictures .

Reminder: the whole noise budget is now being run using median averaging. I used a sqz time from last night where the range was around 165 Mpc starting at GPS 1412603869. Camilla and Sheila took a no-sqz data set today starting at 1412607778. Both data sets are 600 seconds long. I created a new entry in gps_reference_times.yml called ""LHO_O4b_Oct"" with these times. To run the budget: >conda activate aligoNB >python /ligo/gitcommon/NoiseBudget/aligoNB/production_code/H1/lho_darm_noisebudget.py all plots found in /ligo/gitcommon/NoiseBudget/aligoNB/out/H1/lho_darm_noisebudget/ I made one significant edit to the code which is that I decided to separate the laser and input jitter traces on the main DARM noise budget. That means that the laser trace is now only a sum of frequency noise and intensity noise. Input beam jitter is now a trace that combines the pitch and yaw measurements from the IMC WFS. Now due to my changes in the jitter injections detailed above these jitter injections extend above 900 Hz. To reiterate: the injections are still only band-limited around 2 kHz which means that there could be unmeasured jitter noise above 2 kHz that was not captured by this measurement. One reason I wanted to separate these traces is partly because it appears there has been a significant change in the frequency noise. Compared to the last frequency noise measurement the frequency noise above 1 kHz has dropped by a factor of 10. The last time a frequency noise injection was taken was on July 11 right before the OFI vent alog 79037 . After the OFI vent Camilla noticed that the noise floor around 10 kHz appeared to have reduced as well as the HOM peak heights alog 76794 . She posted a follow-up comment on that log today noting that the IFO to OMC mode matching could have an effect on those peaks. This could possibly be related to the decrease in frequency noise. Meanwhile the frequency noise below 100 Hz seems to be about the same as the July measurement. One significant feature in the high frequency portion of the spectrum is a large peak just above 5 kHz. I have a vague memory that this is approximately where a first order mode peak should be but I am not sure. There is no significant change in the intensity noise from July except that there is also a large peak in the intensity noise just above 5 kHz. Gabriele and I talked about this briefly we think this might be gain peaking in the ISS but its hard to tell from alog measurements if that's possible. We think that peak is unlikely to be from the CARM loop. We mentioned the ISS theory to Ryan S. on the off-chance it is related to the current PSL struggles. The other significant change in the noise budget is the change in the LSC noise. The LSC noise has reduced relative to the last noise budget measurement alog 80215 which was expected from the PRCL feedforward implementation. Looking directly at the LSC subbudget PRCL has been reduced by a factor of 10 just as predicted from the FF performance . Now the overall LSC noise contribution is dominated by noise from MICH. Between 10-20 Hz we might be able to win a little more with a better MICH feedforward however that is a very difficult region to fit because of various high Q features ( reminder alog ). Just as in the previous noise budget there is a large amount of unaccounted-for noise. The noise budget code uses a quantum model that Sheila and Vicky have been working on extensively but I am not sure of the status and how much of that noise could be affected by adjustments to the model. Many of the noisy low frequency peaks also appear very broad on the timescale of the noise budget plot. We could try running over a longer period of time to better resolve those peaks. Between 100-500 Hz there are regions where the sum of known noises is actually larger than the measured noise. I think this is because the input jitter projections are made using CAL DELTA L but the overall noise budget is run on CALIB CLEAN where we are running a jitter subtraction.

Short F. Clara S. Dwyer In the ongoing effort to diagnose the source of the glitches seen in the PSL we decided to try moving the NeoLase control box in the PSL racks back to rack power essentially undoing what was done in alog79593 and observe any changes in the glitch behavior. While H1 was unlocked during the commissioning window this morning I shut down the PSL in a controlled manner (in order of ISS FSS PMC AMP2 AMP1 NPRO) then Fil switched CB1 back to rack power and I brought the system back up. When back in the control room we very quickly noticed glitching in the NPRO output power channel as we've seen before and after locking the RefCav the FSS glitches also returned. Deciding this wasn't the solution we were looking for (and concluding it probably wouldn't have changed anything in the first place) I took the PSL down again for Fil to switch back to the bench-top power supply then brough it back up all without issue. Fil also took the opportunity to install a longer cable for this power supply to reduce the trip hazard potential next to the PSL racks. This closes WP 12133 . I'm tagging DetChar since this separate power supply was noted to have helped reduce a 9.5Hz comb seen in DARM but I'll reiterate that functionally nothing here has changed and CB1 remains on its own power supply.

All injections were run with CARM on one sensor (REFL B). The cable for the frequency injection is still plugged in as of this alog but I reset the gains and switches so we are back on two CARM sensors and the injection switch is set to OFF. All injections are saved in the usual /ligo/gitcommon/NoiseBudget/aligoNB/aligoNB/H1/couplings folder under Frequency_excitation.xml IMC_PZT_[P/Y]_inj.xml and PRCL_excitation.xml . I realized an intensity noise injection might be interesting but when I went to run the template for the ISS excitation I was unable to see an excitation. I think there's a cable that must be plugged in to do this? I am not sure. *********Edit************ Ryan S. sent me a message with this alog that has notes about how intensity noise injections should be taken. Through this conversation I realized that I had misread the instructions in the template. I toggled an excitation switch on the ISS second loop screen when I should have instead set the excitation gain to 1. I was allowed another chance to run the intensity injections and I was able to do so using the low middle and high frequency injection templates in the couplings folder. Also the Input jitter injections have in the past been limited to 900 Hz because the IMC WFS channels are DQed at 2048 Hz. However the live IMC channels are at 16 kHz so I edited the IMC injection templates to run up to 7 kHz and use the live channels instead of the DQ channels. That allowed the measurements to run above 900 Hz. However the current injections are band-limited to only 1 or 2 kHz. I think we can widen the injection band to measure jitter up to 7 kHz. I was unable to make those changes because we had to go back to observing so this is future to-do item. I also updated the noise budget code to read in the live traces instead of the DQ traces. Unfortunately in my rush to run these injections I forgot to transition over to one CARM sensor so both the intensity and jitter measurements that are saved are with CARM on REFL A and B.,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80596,elenna.capote@ligo.org

I spent time working on it all of this week and finally tried a setting I found in a Matrikon video about setting up the tunneller. I still don't know why this setting worked but it seems to have solved the initial connection problems. So as long as the OPC server is running which usually starts when the tunneller is started the client connects within a few moments. If the OPC server is not running it should start up after the client is started but it takes time for the server to load its configuration about half a minute. So the client will likely need to be killed and restarted after the OPC server has finished for the client to connect correctly. The way to tell if a restart is necessary is the FMCS data points will all be zero if the client tried to start before the OPC server was finished.The setting I changed in the Matrikon tunneller is in the Classic (COM) Details for the Siemens OPC Server. The setting is the sixth line down and is called Separator Chars and is blank by default. I added a period (.) as a separator character because the server uses a period for each level in the structure to represent a data point. For exampleManagementView.FieldNetworks.LIVINGSTONOBSERVATORY.WESTENDSTATION.Points.AA02AT.ValueIn the above example every period is a step in the tree that takes you to the proper data point location.The separator chars setting is supposed to speed up browsing so I guessed that this might help since timeouts were listed in the logs over and over again. I'm still not sure why this helped or even if it actually helped but since changing this setting the opcua client connects without any problems and with no delays.I also took the time to figure out how to add the missing OPC channel to the Siemens OPC server. In Desigo I added a virtual channel for the PSL room temperature and modified the script that forwards the virtual channels to the OPC server to include the channel I created. So all of the channels from the old OPC server are available in the new OPC server and I was able to receive data for the entire channel list with my test setup.I guess we still need to decide on a startup procedure not sure if Desigo starts automatically but at this time the Matrikon tunneller and the FMCS opcua client need to be started manually.One final concern I have the client running with no security enabled. I have been reading on how to generate security certificates with openssl and Mike T. gave me some pointers but I have not tried to do this yet. I'm not sure if we need to run with security since this is on an internal network but if so this will still need to be worked on before the client is ready.So the client without security is ready but the client with security will need more work.CDS FMCS,"{'term': 'LLO FMCS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73546,marc.lormand@ligo.org

In this case it incorrectly went to the SHUTTER_NO_TRIGGER state instead of the SHUTTER_FAIL state.Tonight around 3:14 UTC we had a lockloss where we had 3.8 volts peak which is above the threshold of 1.5 volts but did not see any action in the GS13 of HAM6. This suggests the fast shutter despite receiving a command to close and reporting that it was in fact closed via the Beckhoff readbacks did not actually kick the table which makes me wonder if it actually closed or closed at its typical speed. I do not see particularly large signals on the OMC DCPDs during the lockloss although our new AS port PD shows a typical amount of power due to a lockloss at the AS port (i.e. L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_11_OUT_DQ) so at the very least the PZT did its job even if the fast shutter didn't. For the moment I've corrected the LOCKLOSS_SHUTTER_CHECK guardian code to do the right comparison i.e. if we don't see a kick of 3e4 counts on the GS13 and the voltage of the trigger PD didn't go above 1.5 Volts then we should go to the SHUTTER_NO_TRIGGER state. In the case of no kick and voltage is higher than threshold (the case we had here) it will now correctly go to the SHUTTER_FAIL state.I've modified ISC_LOCK guardian to not return True in the down state if either we are in the SHUTTER_FAIL (which we will be going forward if this repeats) or the SHUTTER_NO_TRIGGER state keeping the ISC_LOCK guardian in the DOWN state. I'll want to revisit this in the morning or the next lockloss.So in summary DCPDs were protected. Unclear if fast shutter is working or if GS13 may have an issue. I've modified codes so the guardian should not proceed if we again do not see a kick associated with a lockloss irregardless of the threshold level at the moment and I've asked Karla to call me if we lose lock tonight.For reference the last time the LOCKLOSS_SHUTTER_CHECK guardian was in the SHUTTER_NO_TRIGGER state was May 9 2023 and looks like we were having Beckhoff slowcontrols issues and recovering from a power outage then so this looks to be the first real time this has been in this case and probably why I haven't noticed the logic error until now.,"{'term': 'L1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73506,joseph.betzwieser@ligo.org

The d1 values given in the legend for each model are the physical d1 values (based on the model) aka in the same set of d1 values as the ones originally given in the FDR document. Note that these d1 values differ from the d1 values given next to the measurements in Ibrahim's allbbss TFs from yesterday since those d1 values are based on the actual blade locations and theoretical center of mass.

Sheila stopped me from just quickly changing that 3 to a 2 which would have broken the lock. Apparently Shelia relieved one of the Coil Drivers from driving and then changed the state of that Coild Driver while it was not driving. Then turned that coil driver back on and rotated it back into driving with the restof the Coil Drivers. The she would rotate another Coil Driver out of driving to update the state. Maintaining at least 3 coil Drivers at a time. Apparently there is a matrix change from driving with all 4 Coils to driving with 3 coils. Then change the ramp time and value from 3 to 2 then change the matrix to rotate through all 4 coild drivers to ""free"" a different coild driver from driving. is the procedure that kept our lock. Please see Sheila's alog . We believe that there was a change to Prep_for_locking that is supposed to update the state of the coild drivers before locking. P.S.

Attaching some trends of the PSAMS servo working overnight - Screenshot 1 - For ZM4 servo filter bank settings and ndscope trends of a step in the servo setpoint. The PSAMS servo output adjusts the applied voltage (see PZT DC voltage readback eg H1:AWC-ZM4_PSAMS_VOLTAGE_DC) to bring the strain gauge voltage readback (H1:AWC-ZM4_PSAMS_STRAIN_VOLTAGE) to the target setpoint voltage (H1:AWC-ZM4_M2_STRAIN_VOLTAGE_TARGET). Screenshot 2 - ZM245 PSAMS strain gauge voltage trends before/after servo. Before PSAMS servo (last few days) - the applied PSAMS PZT voltage is static and the PSAMS strain gauge voltage readbacks drifts (small amount). After turning on PSAMS servos the applied PSAMS PZT voltages are servo'd to stabilize the strain gauge readbacks to the ""TARGET"" values. Screenshot 3 - ZM5 suspension MEDM screen showing where the PSAMS servo filter bank and target setpoints are. This ZM5 suspension medm screen is in $(userapps)/sus/common/medm/hxds/SUS_CUST_HPDS_OVERVIEW.adl (Sheila helped us svn-commit this screen from LLO then Daniel pulled it for use at LHO). Daniel updated the PSAMS servo parts in the AWC block of h1tcscs.mdl found in userapps/trunk/tcs/h1/models. The SDF's appeared in the h1tcscs table (in the ""OAF"" box on the sdf screen). Daniel has sdf-monitored the PSAMS filter banks and left the ZM PSAMS PZT offsets sdf-monitored. Note these pzt offset values are basically meaningless when the servo is running. The ZM2/4/5 offsets are now all SDF'd around 100V so they would come back to ~nominal values after any resets.

Violins: We lost lock at 00:09 UTC (lockloss alog 80697 ) and have not been able to get to NLN since. A local earthquake rung violins up violently such that some are in the 8/9 zone. While the alignment is great (DRMI locked without PRMI 5 times) we have IX saturations starting at PARK_ALS_VCO. I initially thought this was an ALS or maintenance Tuesday issue but that doesn't seem to be the case. After chatting to Jenne we realized that it was indeed the violins. So I started damping. Setting all violins to their nominal damping states successfully prevented IX from saturating at ENGAGE_ASC_FOR_FULL_IFO where it was saturating consistently. Moving to CHECK_VIOLINS_BEFORE_POWERUP results in 1 saturation/second losing lock eventually (after 30 mins or so). Any form of powerup also loses lock immediately. I talked to Rahul and he recommended staying at a steady state to damp for a few hours since sometimes it just takes that long. Spoke to the incoming operator TJ and he's been informed of the unsteady state of the IFO. I'm already past this state but my recommendation (from speaking to Rahul) would be to stay at PREP_ASC_FOR_FULL_IFO at nominal damping for a few hours.,"{'term': 'LHO General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80699,ibrahim.abouelfettouh@ligo.org

Oberling After the NPRO control box was swapped last week and glitches persisted (see alog80566 ) we decided it would be best to switch back to the original so that signal readbacks for the NPRO would be accurate. I started by bringing down the PSL in a controlled manner (ISS FSS PMC AMPs NPRO) then went out to the LVEA PSL racks and swapped control box S/N S2200008 for S2200009. Since this is the control box that had previously been in service with this NPRO laser head no adjustments were needed to set the temperature and current to be correct. I returned to the control room and brought the whole system back up without issue. Once it was time to lock the FSS similar to what was needed with the last control box swap I manually moved the NPRO temperature down about 0.4K (from 0.19 to -0.23) and locked the RefCav so that the SQZ laser would be happy. I then updated the FSS search parameters and accepted them in SDF (see screenshot ). As I noted in the 10-day trends yesterday (see alog80665 ) PMC REFL has risen over the past week so I attempted a remote alignment tweak using the picomotors before the PMC. In the end I wasn't able to make much of any improvement to the PMC alignment. I also attempted a remote alignment tweak for the RefCav and here I was able to get a slight improvement from 0.80V to 0.81V on the TPD. Looking for more things to try to impact the laser glitching and hopefully bring down the amount of PMC reflected power Jason and I returned to the PSL racks to try adjusting the NPRO pump current. We ultimately raised the current from 2.12A to 2.19A increasing the NPRO output power from 1.82W to 1.91W according to the PD in front of the laser but not having much of an impact on the PMC. We also tried slightly altering pump diode currents in the amplifiers but we didn't see any improvement so these remain as they were. I concluded our PSL activities today with a rotation stage calibration following the steps in alog79596 . The measurement file new calibration fit and screenshot of accepting SDFs are attached.

DAQ restart was required the addition of 51 slow channels. WP12132 New Dolphin adapter card Firmware. Keith Jonathan Erik EJ Tony Dave: Downgraded firmware was loaded onto the Dolphin IX-611 adapter cards in h1sush7 h1cdsh8 and h1oaf0. This is to prevent sponteneous PCI level switching which is possibly the cause of some O4 cornerstation Dolphin glitches. Procedure was: safe the systems running on the frontend fence the frontend from the Dolphin fabric stop all the models run the script to load the new firmware power down the frontend then pull the two power cords out for about a minute plug the power cords in power up let it boot and start the models. WP12134 DAQ Restart Script Restart rts-nds.service Jonathan Erik Dave: To prevent /run/nds/jobs filling the scripts to restart the DAQ was modified to restart the rts-nds.service on the nds machines as well as restarting their rts-daqd.services. This allows systemd to empty the /run/nds/jobs directory which was over 50% full on h1daqnds1. We tested this as part of this morning's DAQ restart it worked well. WP12087 Add VACSTAT gauge PVs to DAQ Dave: My first attempt to add the VACSTAT PVs relating to vacuum gauge monitoring failed because the channel names exceeded the DAQ length limit of 54 characters. I modified the VACSTAT code to drop the _PRESS_TORR from the PT channels names which allowed these channels to be added to the DAQ. A new H1EPICS_VACSTAT.ini file was created which added 368 channels to the EDC. DAQ and EDC restart was needed. The new VACSTAT IOC was restarted and the new MEDMs installed into production. WP12143 Replace failed SDD in h1guardian1 Dave Jonathan Erik: cds_report reported a failed disk in h1guardian1's md3 raid at noon today. Jonathan and Erik found a failed 230GB SDD which is part of the root file system on h1guardian1. It was replaced with a 1TB SSD (the smallest we have) resyning the new disk only took about an hour. DAQ Restart Jonathan Erik Dave: We restarted the DAQ for the addition of h1tcscs slow channels and the new VACSTAT EDC channels. EDC was restarted its channel count increased from 57061 to 57429. This was the first test of the new restart script which after doing the round of rts-daqd restarts then restarts rts-nds on the nds machines. The only problem was a spontaneous retstart of framewriter 1 after it had written about 3 full frames.

I couldn't resist and it didn't take that long. I attach the unit-full transfer functions between the ISI Sus. Point Drive DOFs (L P Y and T) and the Top Mass SUS M1 OSEMs response in L P Y.It's.... a complicated collection of TFs and this isn't all of them that are relevant!Just to make the point that Dan DeBra taught Brian Lantz who taught me and we're passing down to Edgard Bonilla: *every* DOF matters the one you ignore is the one that will bite you.The transverse T DOF drive data set demonstrates this point. None of these transverse to LPY couplings nominally exist if we just consider first principles equations of rigid-body motion of an ideal suspension. But alas the on-resonance coupling from T to L P Y ranges from 0.1 ... to 50 [m/m] or [rad/m]. I may need to drive the ISI with an entirely different color of excitation to resolve these transfer functions above 5 Hz where it's perhaps most interesting for DARM but this is a good start.The ISI drive templates have been re-committed to the repo with the calibrations of each channel in place. (It was really easy: just multiplying each channel by the appropriate 1e-9 [m/nm] or 1e-6 [m/um] in translation and similar 1e-9 [rad/nrad] or 1e-6 [rad/urad].) ,"{'term': 'H1 SEI', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80688,jeffrey.kissel@ligo.org

KisselWP 12140 I've completed 6 SUS + 4 ISI = 10 of 12 total DOF excitations that I wanted to drive before I ran out of time this morning. Each drive was ""successful"" in that I was able to get plenty of coherence between the 4 DOFs of ISI drive and SUS response and some coherence between 6 SUS drive DOFs and ISI response. As expected the bulk of the time was spent tuning the ISI excitations. I might have time to ""finish"" the data set and get the last two missing DOFs but I was at least able to get both directions of LPY to LPY transfer functions which are definitely juicy enough to get the analysis team started.Measurement environmental/configuration differences of the HAM2 ISI from how they are nominally in observing: - PR3 M1 DAMP local damping loop gains are at -0.2 where they are nominally at -1.0. (The point of the test.) - CPS DIFF is OFF. (needed to do so for maintenance day) - Coil Driver z:p = 1:10 Hz analog low-pass (and digital compensation for it) is OFF. (need to do so to get good SNR on SUS M1 drive without saturating the SUS DACs)Interesting things to call out that are the same as observing: - The PR3 alignment sliders were ON. P = -122 [urad] Y = 100 [urad]. (Don't *expect* dynamics to change with ON vs. OFF but we have seen diagonal response change if close an EQ stop. Haven't ever looked but I wouldn't be surprised of off-diagonal responses change. Also DAC range gets consumed by DC alignment request which is important for driving transfer functions.) - Corner station sensor correction informed by the Bier Garten ""ITMY"" T240 on the ground. (the h1oaf0 computer got booted this morning so we had to re-request the SEI_CS configuration guardian to be in WINDY. The SEI_ENV guardian had been set to LIGHT_MAINTENANCE.) - PR3 is NOT under any type of ISC global control neither L P or Y. (global ISC feedback for the PRC's LPY DOFs goes to PRM and PR2.) There are too many interesting transfer functions to attach or even to export in the limited amount of time I have.

The downside of this is that the wiring of its data cable is not compatible with the current CDS setup and therefore on the MEDM screen the AIP still appears as faulty - see picture attached. The controller will be replaced shortly after the Varian controller is fixed. Until then the Agilent controller will be periodically checked.Nevertheless the Noble-diode pump proved to be an excellent choice again as it pumped the Annulus volume down pretty quickly (in about 7 minutes) below 1E-6 Torr. ,"{'term': 'LHO VE', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80686,janos.csizmazia@ligo.org

To prepare for the CO2Y laser swap next week: TJ and I moved the spare CO2 laser that just got re-gassed (S/N 20706 / alt link ) out to the LVEA. Turned on the FLIR camera and checked beam position with no mask central and annular masks. Checked the beam centering on irises (used PWM for iris before power control) and used new Thorlabs VCR6S detector cards which were great! The beam was to the upper left on first and second iris (didn't move irises). The beam was centered on the last two irises. We didn't scribe the current CO2 position at it was already pushed up against multiple beam dumps to record it's position. All water tubes were correctly labeled photo of laser pipe order the RF driver to laser cables were labeled on both sides as they connect to the laser see photo for how to plug into RF driver . ,"{'term': 'H1 TCS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80679,camilla.compton@ligo.org

Also since the NPRO controller was swapped 5 days ago but the potentiometers on the daughter board were not adjusted on the one swapped in ( alog80566 ) some of the readbacks for the NPRO channels are reporting inaccurate values namely the laser diode powers. The controller is planned to be swapped back to the original tomorrow so these readbacks will be fixed. Other item of note is that every time the PMC was unlocked last week it seems to have relocked with a slightly higher reflected power and corresponding lower transmitted power (see stabilization trends ). Looking at the PMC REFL camera image there could be something to gain from an alignment tweak into the PMC so I'll try that tomorrow during maintenance and see if there's any improvement. ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80665,ryan.short@ligo.org

These changes have been highly successful at increasing the range particularly the most recent couple of OPO changes. However this type of rapid improvement in the spectrum can create challenges when measuring the spectrum of the data in downstream data analysis pipelines (similar to how the sudden turn-on of the line subtraction was problematic). When the OPO adjustment has created significant changes to the spectrum the time periods during the transition should be CAT1 vetoed (tagging Detchar-request). As an example of these transitions I've included a range timeseries and a daily spectrogram with the transition time indicated. I also have included a before/after spectrum comparison showing the broadband improvement at high frequency. To mitigate the impact on data analysis pipelines future transitions should either be made while briefly out of observing or tracked by Detchar for CAT1 vetoes.

37053,H1 PEM - Identification of 30-40 Hz peaks in DARM,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=80655,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Sun, 13 Oct 2024 23:55:00 -0700",Over the summer Sam Robert and I investigated several peaks in DARM including one at ~35.4 Hz and a peak that oscillates between 30-40 Hz. The 35.4 Hz peak was found to couple strongly at HAM1 and HAM6 (see alog 79546 ). Shut-offs of the office area air handler and the main chillers showed that the peak decreases when these systems are shut off though it doesn't disappear completely. See Figure 1 and Figure 2 with office area air handler shut offs at 19:33:00-19:38:30 and 19:43:00-19:55:00 (alog 79888 ) and Figure 3 for main chiller shut offs (alog 73941 ). Note that there is also a fainter peak about 0.2 Hz above the 35.4 Hz peak as seen in Figure 4 but it is unclear if it also decreases when the HVAC is shut off. The oscillating 30-40 Hz peak tends to be near 40 Hz at the beginning and end of the UTC day and drops to near 30 Hz in the middle of the day as seen in Figure 5 .

I investigated the checks that RyanS went through last night in alog80639 to no avail I also tried setting FC1 & 2 back to their spots from the last time we locked the SQZer using OSEMs which didn't help either.

Huyen Brian O WP #11849 Starting Plan for the day for the fast shutter detailed in alog 73594 SUMMARY OF WORK: D1003325 fast shutter cap (which has the horns on it) removed from the fast shutter assembly 5 (the one that came from LHO) and the horn removed. The fast shutter alignment was checked and the fast shutter bobbin height was adjusted a little but and the overall position of the assembly has been moved from what it was prior to our entry into the chamber to allow for more clearance from the wire and to have the beam go into the beam dump. The modified fast shutter cap with the removed horn has been installed. Activity Log: ALL particle counts will be delivered in Cubic Feet in 0.3um/0.5um/1.0um size. All times are CDT. 08:30 LVEA is laser hazard 08:30 Removed shutter logic box to EE lab S1203627 08:30am HAM7 cleanroom Particle Counts 20/10/10 08:31am Removing the ""horn"" piece ( D1003325 ) from Spare Fast Shutter S/N 002 to modify it to remove one of the horns 0849am In HAM5/6 cleanroom PC 0/0/0 08:52am In HAM6 chamber PC 20/10/10 08:54am Checking fast shutter alignment in HAM6 with the beam flashes and adjusting fast shutter position and alignment so that beam hits the tombstone and it reflects the beam into the beam dump. It had to be rotate some and they have to increase the height of the tombstone. They are using the slotted adjusters on the fast shutter assembly to try to bring it up ~2mm. 09:24am Removing the position markers we put down to mark the fast shutter position as we have moved the fast shutter and they are no longer relevant and we may need the holes to dog clamp it 09:27am Checking alignments of various beams on the fast shutter and taking some videos of where the beams are etc 09:45am Happy with alignment of everything. Beam is about 1cm from the wire. But fast shutter has moved in position slightly so we will have to rebalance the ISI we believe. This pic shows the new position of the fast shutter on HAM6 ISI 09:58am Going laser safe in LVEA 09:50am Removing the fast shutter cap (the part that has the stops on it) from the installed assembly. Removing D1003325-V2 S/N 005 09:58am In chamber Particle Counts 30/10/10 10:02am Modified part has arrived and we will install. The Part number is D1003325-V2 S/N 004. Taking some pics of the part. The wrong leg that we wanted to be machined off was cut off. 10:04am Installing part on the fast shutter. Unfortunately we cant make it work. Luckily we have a spare to modify. So we are now going to modify D1003325 S/N 005 10:09am.

Adam is going to move the wire a little bit more. 11:15am Tested a bit more slow up and down with the bobbin. Adam is more happy with how the wire is now. He is taking some pics of it. 11:17am Setting up for testing the fast shutter at operational speed ~100x 11:29am High voltage on and getting ready to start our tests 11:30am Test fire #1 while filming. Looking at movie taken to see if we are happy with everything 11:37am Test fire #2 while filming. Investigating the mirror/peek bobbin etc and everything looks good. 11:39am Going to start doing a number of test fires. Test #3->#5. 11:42am Starting to do test #6->#20 11:58am Starting to do test #21 while filming again to try to get a better video with better lighting 11:59am Starting test #22->#30 12:03pm Adjusting camera angle to get a better picture when filming 12:10pm Starting test # 31->#40. Taking a break to see if we see anything in terms of stress points on the mirror bobbin glue joints etc. We used a FLIR camera to look at the heating of the wire shutter etc to see if we observe overheating from firing it repeatedly. (This is also why we are only doing this in a small grouping before breaking) 12:20pm Starting test #41->#50. We thin k we might see evidence of the wire touching the remaining stop. They are going to try to alter the wire a bit more. 12:30pm Turning OFF high voltage so that we can adjust the wires/clamping of the wire thats hitting the remaining stop 01:10pm Turning ON high voltage so that we can try to do more tests. Starting Test #51->60 01:18pm Wanting to hook up trigger box. During that we heard (and it was seen) that the fast shutter went up and down 'violently' (we could hear it outside the cleanroom) up and down at a reasonably fast speed . 01:25pm Wanting to do more tests but with the paddle again. Starting Test #61->70 1:29pm Doing one last inspection of the Bobbin and we see no cracks etc. Looks the same as it did at the start. 01:30pm Turning OFF high voltage 01:32pm Finishing up some cable dressing on the ISI. 01:41pm Exit particle counts in chamber 30/20/20 01:46pm Exit in cleanroom particle counts 10/0/0 Handing over to ISI balancing team while we take lunch ","{'term': 'L1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73595,matthew.heintze@ligo.org

Overall this leads to a counter clockwise rotation of HAM6 and a shift in the positive Y. To measure the position of the ISI and Stage 0 we selected a few holes on each surface that we could easily get with the FARO. As expected we found that the ISI has a similar shift and rotation as its support tubes (0.246 degrees). The tabletop is also ~1.8 mm higher than the CAD drawing.

Calum joined by zoom. We then met again at 0800 CDT this morning and decided on this plan of action for today. - We will remove one of the hard stops the one that was closest to being impacted by a flexing wire. We feel that the history of use and the design makes this a safe option. Joe Hanson will perform the surgery using clean tools. - We will transition to laser hazard and Anamaria Adam and others will work to reposition the fast shutter so that the flexing wires are not close to the interferometer beam. - The modified hard stop will be installed and we will then test the fast shutter for 50-100 cycles with periodic inspections for signs of damage. Our estmate is that this is 5-10% of the expected number of cycles the shutter will undergo for the remainder of O4. - If we have a failure then our fallback is to try to repair the kinked wire in the original fast shutter assembly. This is not ideal but should allow us to return to operation while a better replacement is made ready. More details to follow.

The limit stops for the fast shutter are only there to prevent the bobbin jumping out upon catastrophic failure. The stops should be set well above the range of motion described by the bobbin during normal cycling. The bobbin slows to a stop on its upward travel by use of magnetic breaking afforded by the magnetic field set up by the current from the driver. Bad things happen if the driver terminates its pulse while the bobbin is moving upwards as there is no breaking. That's when the mechanical limit stops come into play. If the bobbin hits the limit stops it will likely break so that should be avoided and is not a factor if the system is not malfunctioning in some way. Another little thing buried in history is that of the dressing of the thin Teflon wires used in the bobbin flexible connection. By studying the high speed camera footage we opted for a dressing style that minimized the observed whip-like wire motion present in the earlier attempts. One should endeavor to duplicate the lengths and shapes seen in the installed unit as it reflects the best known practice to avoid whip failure of the wires as they flex. Best of luck to you all.

At one point we checked the voltage output from the driver and coudln't get it to change from 14V so in the interest of speed we just grabbed the spare hooked up power outside the rack (but not the high voltage or beckhoff slow controls connection) confirmed that output expected voltages and used that for testing.Turns out we had forgotten a safety feature of the Beckhoff slow controls for the high voltage driver was to maintain the fast shutter in a closed (up) state if the high voltage is not ready as a safety precaution to protect the down stream photodiodes. Since we had turned off the high voltage on Friday to do testing the Beckhoff system was forcing the chassis to constantly put out 14 volts and because the bobbin in the spare fast shutter was installed backwards was constantly forcing it down when we did the initial connection with the original high voltage driver.Testing today in the EE shop has confirmed normal functioning of the original high voltage driver chassis and it was just a mistake on our part along with the reversed polarity of the fast shutter which confused us initially. So despite suspicion early in the week there was no failure of the original driver just the fast shutter wiring.We are discussing how to setup a safe measurement of the high voltage drive to confirm the output signal matches expectation and nothing funny happened with the spare driver chassis when we had the spare fast shutter catastrophic failure.,"{'term': 'L1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73577,joseph.betzwieser@ligo.org

We are currently waiting on a spare Bobbin to come from LHO (from 3rd IFO) to try to repair one of the units we have. We do not believe we can repair either of the units we have right now. Below is a quick summary of where we are at: Original Fast Shutter S/N 005 * Issues with measuring open loop where we should of measured 20 ohm resistance for the coils * During debugging to try to find the issue two pins on the in-vacuum cable (at the flange) became dislodged. We didn't really touch them that vigorously so suspect that they were getting closer to being at a failure point and us touching it just was the final ""straw that broke the camels back"" of failure * Swapping to a new in-vacuum cable did not allow the original fast shutter to be operational. Our current suspicion(but still to be proven) is that it might be due to a kinked wire (the black tube Anamaria is holding in the picture is what the wire normally goes inside of and the kink is at the top of this tube) Spare Fast Shutter S/N 002 *New shutter Installed. Had to be installed 180 degrees in rotation to the original rotation as Bobbin installed backwards and so HR side of fast shutter mirror was facing the ing the wrong way. Also when we cabled it up as per the original fast shutter the polarity was backwards. * Connected up fast shutter so that the polarity was correct and fast shutter HR mirror was facing the correct way. Using the paddle controller to control the fast shutter we were successfully able to command the fast shutter to go slow up and slow down as per our commands (and the correct direction). * We installed the fast shutter in position (we had marked the position of the old shutter). We had to shim underneath the length of the fast shutter to alter the pitch of the beam from the fast shutter into the beam dump as the beam was ~1inch too low. * Clamping of the wires to not touch be caught get in the way of beams was where we spent the most time yesterday * Once we were happy we tested the fast shutter first with 'slow up' and 'slow down' commands and it worked fine. we then tested it ~ 5 times at its operational speed ('fast up'). End of Day 1 *This morning we finished cable dressing the cable from the ISI to stage zero and then unlocked the ISI to test the fast shutter one final time (in its ""fast up"" state) to see if we saw the usual ""kick"" in the sensors on the ISI we typically see when the fast shutter fires and also to take a slow motion video (with a phone) to see the operation. It was on this final test of the fast shutter that the tombstone part of the fast shutter broke away from the rest of the peek part it is glued to and landed on the table. *Note: Adam and I were the ones chamber side when this final shutter actuation took place. We have high confidence the broken part did not hit anything else in HAM6. It hit the flashlight I was holding above the fast shutter and landed on an open piece of real estate in front of the fast shutter (on the -Y side of the shutter). * Additional note: Ive added a picture of the part that failed and also a picture of how it should be attached (picture courtesy of Betsy at LHO who has a dirty unit and has been supporting us also from afar). * One more additional note: When we had the two side by side (""spare"" one that failed on the left and ""Original"" one on the right) we see that the hard stops on the spare is much lower than what the original hard stops was set to General Non-image files attached to this report fastshutterfailure.mov ","{'term': 'L1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73576,matthew.heintze@ligo.org

I have the ISP-1000 and its respective logic fully operational. The ISP-1000 is using the same push buttons on the Turbo panel as the old screw pumps and has the same inlet valve logic as the HEPTAs. The automatic set point via a labjack T4 has been installed but the relay driver tick on pins FIO5 FIO4 GND and VS is not operating as expected. The Labjack is reading the voltages from both gauges and converting to pressure. It then updates the setpoint only if pressure is dropping. However if the pressure rises above the setpoint the Labjack reports that the setpoint is tripped but it fails to write FIO5 low to trip the safety valve. I am using the same Labjack and program that I had previously tested successfully in the VPW last week. We also think that the tick might be directionally dependent for how voltage is applied to the tick relay contacts RA RB and GND. Further testing is required. If this cant be resolved the dual range gauge is still wired in series with the labjack and it can be used to set a static setpoint just like we had before.

She is opening the top of the soft cover. 1322 In-chamber PC: 30/20/10 1323 Anamaria is going to index the fast shutter location with Adam M. 1328 Index complete. Joe B and Michael have moved the (newly replaced on Friday Oct 11) fast shutter driver chassis from beside the chamber to inside of the rack. 1330 De-cabling and removing the fast shutter. Leaving the spacer. Anamaria is bringing the new fast shutter into the chamber. CLASS A Spare Fast Shutter D1003318-2 https://ics.ligo-la.caltech.edu/JIRA/browse/ASSY-D1003318-2 1337 They’ve cabled up the new shutter Michael L is garbing to check the cabling. Putting the dog clamps back on for now. Will have to tighten up after re-alignment. Lockers are still on the shutter. 1340 Joe B is checking at the in-air cable at the chassis connector. Looks healthy. He plugged it into the chassis. 1342 Joe B turned on the chassis and Anamaria heard the clunk as expected. Slow up is working. Checked twice. It went down when he removed his finger from the paddle for slow up. Michael L is checking Anamaria’s connections. 1346 UP is closed. Joe B hooked up Beckhoff but the high voltage is not on so he can’t use Beckhoff to open it but the readout looked OK. So he unhooked Beckhoff. Michael L has verified that Anamaria’s connections are OK. 1353 Taking photos of WFS A. We need to go laser hazard for the rest of the tests. 1410 We are laser Hazard. Joe B is isolating LVEA ISIs except for HAM6 because its locked. 1413 Trying to lock IMC. Trying single bounce. SRM Is 2000 counts off due to Anamaria’s intentional misalignment. PRM is off 2000 counts again due to Anamaria’s intentional misalignment. 1423 Aligning all suspensions they were in a safe state. 1427 All SUS are untripped all ISIs are untripped and Anamaria sees flashes. 1430 Anamaria feels that it is aligned enough to close the shutter. Joe B hooked up Beckhoff and the shutter closed. The alignment is a bit low. Opening the shutter. Opened. Adam M and Anamaria are checking the alignment. About 3mm. 1436 Adam asked Joe B to close the shutter. Huyen is checking the locked ISI position to see if that’s a factor. Huyen reports that the ISI is only about 7 microns down in that corner. So Anamaria and Adam M agree to remove the spacer underneath. There is a chance that the old shutter was at a different vertical spacing than this one. 1443 Removed the spacer under the fast shutter. Checking now. It looks perfectly centered. The new shutter points down a bit so it hits the beam dump lower. They are adjusting the beam dump. 1448 Aligning the fast shutter. It’s pitched. 23” x 12” working out the angle that it is off in pitch. D1201293-v2 wedged blocks may work. They are made to different angles. 1457 Considering a 3 deg wedge and that’s too much. Matt is getting some Class A alum strips which could run the length of the fast shutter bottom plate. 1510 Trying Alum strip. 1515 Strip seems to work give good angle. Checking with the beam – making sure that the wire is not clipping the beam. Looks good. 1522 Moving folks away from the chamber as Joe B turns on the high voltage. He’s engaged the high voltage. Checking functionality. Down and up. Checking a few times. Turning the high voltage power supply off. 1541 Taking a video of the beam of the fast shutter with the shutter down/open. They’ll take the video again with the shutter up/closed. Putting Beckhoff back on so Josh does not need to hold the button on the paddle. Huyen has a complicated video camera and is providing instructions. 1554 Final configuration needed for wires. Clamping them down. Adam M and Michael L working on this cable dressing. 1600 List of activities remaining - check for fast shutter repeatability pointing & hysteresis check beams on WFSs unlock ISI. Decided to input an after-hours work permit to complete this today. We have an operator in the chair until 7pm. 1622 Joe B is slowly opening the fast shutter. Now putting it back up. Checking beam pointing. Putting it down. Checking it going up and down. Looks good – Anamaria wants to loosen one of the cable clamps. It may sit a bit more flush/further back which is good. 1629 Modifying the cable clamp now. Making a new one. 1653 Still getting the cable dressing just right. It’s better. Checking the up and down slowly. Joe B is using the paddle to cycle through ups and downs. Cable dressing discussion. More discussion. 1712 More cycling of the shutter. One wire is slightly touching but touching something soft. They’re taking photos. 1717 Taking a video of fast shutter opening and closing slowly with paddle. Setting up Beckhoff for fast shutter opening and closing fast. Joe B is going to turn on high voltage. They have their reference. Joe B has turned on high voltage and reading back 150 V. Triggering fast shutter with Beckhoff. A wire moved (bad). Turning off high voltage. Disconnecting the high voltage cable from the chassis. May have bent the wire. They need to remove the slight twist in that one wire. 1728 They removed the clamps and are now trying to untwist the wire so it’s straight. 1748 Anamaria showed what the wiring issue is with the viton tubing photo. She found a kink in the wire of the old fast shutter. Could be the problem. 1805 Re-dressing the cables. Testing the fast shutter with the paddle. The wire is not touching. Joe B is hooking up the high voltage to perform the fast test. It is now turned on. Capacitors are charging. Fully charged to 230 V. Testing fast opening and closing. 1814 Taking a video of the shutter closing and opening. Going to laser safe. Turning off high voltage. It’s off. We are laser safe.

It was bent to clear that. 0959 Michael L taking continuity measurements. Direct resistance of the fast shutter coil. 1000 Across the peek screw terminal – across the coil open. Trying again – still recording open. Now he’s measuring directly to the pins – still open. Screw terminal connecting two wires vertically – should see 20 ohms but it is open. He put the probes on the screws and the end of the barrel for the measurement. We will need to replace the fast shutter itself. They measured vertically across and horizontally across. Reference https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/uploads/73522_20241010123110_IMG_2038.jpg 1003 Taking a photo down at the bobbin. 1005 Michael L says that the screws seem tight. Josh suggested measuring across the in-series terminal block. He sees open. 1007 Anamaria is climbing up to take a look. She can manually move the shutter. 1012 They are going to try removing the screws that are holding the pins in on the bobbin side. 1012 Turning the illuminator off as it’s shining in their eyes. 1013 Anamaris is holding one probe Michael L is holding the other probe. End to end on the bobbin. It’s open. Still open when Anamaria is moving along the pin with the probe – still open. With one particular position of the probes it reads 20 – 22 ohms. 1016 Randomly the north crane is working. 1017 Between pin a and c should be a short. 1019 Seems like its coming back and forth – they’re measuring the coil again. Fluctuating between 20 ohm and 100 and open. We see 20 ohms through the coil itself but not at the terminal block. But they didn’t see that in the beginning. Manipulating the pins a bit now shows 20 ohms. 1024 Josh is going to get the probe clips with the toothed jaws. Going to install the pins again into the terminal block. It now measures 20 ohms. They screwed the cable at the outside of the chamber flange back in and are going to check it at the chassis. A and B should be 20 ohms. https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/uploads/73522_20241010123110_IMG_2038.jpg 1028 A and B at the chassis is 20 ohms A to C is 20 ohms B to D is 1.4 ohms A and C is 1.2 ohms. 1029 They are switching out the probes to ones with toothed jaw to remeasure in-chamber. All they did was reseat the pins. But that doesn’t explain the B to D short. 1031 They screwed in everything. Anamaria is agitating the inner connector at the flange it went open. Then it went back to 22 ohms. Fluctuating short to 22 ohms when she’s manipulating the connector. Pointing towards feedthrough or cable. We have not had it steady open which is what she’s trying to induce. She can’t get it to stay open. So she’s checking B and D now. It’s reading 1-2 ohms. She’s moving the cable. Steady open then back to 1. Flickering now…still. She’s pressing it back and it’s at 2ohms but it’s flickering between 1 to 5 ohms. Flickering between 1 and open. 1038 Taking the whole connector out of the feedthrough flange to do a continuity check at the connector. Two wires came loose from two cable connector pins. Speculation that the connector at the flange got loose. They’ve measured the in-air cable many times but they’ll try it again. They’ll have to swap the in-chamber cable. They’ll test the fast shutter by itself. 1059 They are removing the in-chamber cable from the cable clamps traveling up the HAM ISI. 1100 Anamaria is removing the cable at the PEEK. She needs to add black glass back into the holder. 1103 They are putting the new cable in chamber. There is no serial number on the cable. They are considering moving the terminal block so the wire won’t have to turn so sharply. They are not going to change the position of the terminal block but are going to reconfigure the pins to try to avoid bending the pin/wire connection on the cable. 1111 For reference https://dcc.ligo.org/DocDB/0114/D1400225/001/FastShutterAirVacWiringChain_v1.pdf 1115 They’ll wait to dress the new cable after testing. 1121 They’re testing pin 2 to 4 which is supposed to be short and it’s showing 0.7. One connection is still fluctuating but now shows 20ohms. Michael L is double checking the B and D as open Rechecking the coil by moving the probe up and down the crimp pins. Looks good. 1126 Anamaria is connecting the new cable to the feedthrough. 1127 They are using the new driver with the paddle (test board). Connecting up the cable to the driver. Turning on the driver. She heard something not sure what. Michael L says that he didn’t see the shutter move but perhaps the shutter moved when the driver was powered up. He remembers that from Friday. Testing slow up. Testing slow down. Nothing happened to the shutter for each. Power cycling the driver. Pressing slow up – light goes on. Nothing happened. Turning the driver off again. They’re going to do a whole continuity measurement. 1131 Josh and Huyen are checking at the cable. A and B is open which should be 20. B to C is 1-2 ohms but then it was jumping around. Anamaria will screw in the connector at the feedthrough better. She’s waiting for a longer L-key. 1144 Josh is checking the driver itself. A and B is measuring 14 volts. It looks good. 1135 Anamaria has completed reseating the connector. 1136 Back to rechecking the cable. Open connections. Some cursing. Re-jostling. Seeing fluctuations. Open. More cursing. 1139 Wires are not marked so it doesn’t look like there is laser damage. 1143 Taking lots of photos including of the WFSs and REFL PD. By eye we did not see any damage. 1152 Taking In-chamber PC before putting on soft cover: 200/25/00 1154 Cable has not been fully dressed. Soft cover halfway down for FARO work.

I've used a 3 hour stretch of observing time for the old NPRO and a three hour stretch before the time when Jenne made a plot in 80837 . The ISS is not on for the new NPRO time which is probably why the intensity is flcutuating and making it harder to see the small steps in power that are the glitches we are looking for. In the second panel I've plotted the data high passed with a 0.05 Hz butterworth this helps to show the glitches although not perfectly (in either case).

Overall the squeezer pump ISS is working and ready. With GAOM1 an inch closer to SHG maybe GAOM1 alignment got smoother than before. We have an alignment that can optimize both 0-th order throughput and diffraction efficiency which seemed problematic in recent realignments (eg 80266 79993 78519 ). With 43mW into GAOM1 we transmitted 40mW at 0V (so 40/43 = 93% throughput) while being able to diffract ~15mW at 5V (28.5 dBm) so ~35% diffraction efficiency. Seems ok-good compared to recent re-alignments. Pump fiber coupling might be improvable (see lho72081 for reference) but is OK for now. With 20 mW launched into the fiber we had about 2 (BS50:50) * (2.2mW (opo_refl unlocked) + 1mW (opo_refl_rejected)) = 6.4mW through the fiber so 6.4/20 ~ 32% throughput even with ~0.1mW mis-polarized light. Given the questionable yaw beam quality when no parts are installed on the SHG output path and the dependence of yaw beam profile on SHG temperature it might require work on SHG to totally solve the beam quality issues. Unclear that further mode-matching adjustments will fix it. First attchment here plots all the beam profile measurements from this round (friday and tuesday). Same as Tuesday. Pitch looks good. Yaw does not look consistent with pitch and not quite gaussian either. See photos of the beam profiles in the second attachment here : the yaw profile degrades as we go further from SHG while the pitch profiles look consistently good. Yaw profile looked bad even with no EOM or AOM installed so it is a bigger issue. Could be related to SHG problems since the yaw profile depends so much on SHG temperature. After adjusting the EOM alignment the yaw beam looked more single-peaked after the EOM but was still not a great gaussian (see photos ) and it got worse as the beam propagated farther from SHG.

Short J. Oberling Weekend work on the PSL NPRO swap continuing on from Friday . Saturday 10/26 We started today by taking a beam propagation measurement with only L01 installed to get a better idea of if it was properly positioned as our Gaussian fit for the Amp1 beam was well off what we expected from JamMT. However the resulting Gaussian fit didn't make sense so we took another propagation measurement. This fit differed from the first so we suspected either something was up with the profiler or something in the beam path was distorting the beam (or maybe both). To check if something was up with the profiler we switched profilers from the WinCam to the ThorLabs scanning slit this required a different rail setup since the ThorLabs is larger than the WinCam and would be well above the beam with the rail we were using (we tried mounting it a couple different ways to the original rail we were using to no avail). We took a profile and got a completely different result for the fit. I'm writing this from home so I don't have the numbers on me at the moment. Going back to the WinCam and looking at the beam shape on the profiler the beam wasn't exactly good looking (see first attachment). Since we had seen the EOM change beam alignment I tried moving it around a bit while watching the WinCam and sure enough as the EOM alignment changed the beam shape changed. At this point we broke for lunch. After lunch we removed the EOM from the beam path and looked at the profiler again 2nd attachment. The beam was more round and less ""stretched."" So we took another beam propagation measurement with the EOM removed. This one was different from the rest and did not match what we expected based on JamMT's results with a f = +222mm lens 100.0mm from the NPRO. Now the suspicion is our initial beam propagation measurement in the lab was somehow wrong. At this point I remembered that while in the lab we needed 1.67A to get ~1.8W out of the NPRO as measured by one of the small stick power meters this same NPRO installed in the PSL needs 2.144A for ~1.86W. My guess is the power meter in the lab is suspect and if so means we were under-pumping the NPRO during the initial beam propagation measurement. Under-pumping the NPRO changes the divergence of the output beam and therefore our Gaussian fit and mode matching. To check this we set a turning mirror to direct the leakage beam from M01 into a beam profiler and took a propagation measurement. Sure enough the results differed from what we got in the lab: Horizontal Waist: 153.0 µm @ -102.0 mm Vertical Waist: 143 µm @ -90.3 mm Pretty different from what we had in the lab which meant we had to redo the mode matching again. We were able to find what looked like a good solution see final attachment. We broke for the day at this point it had been a long one. Sunday 10/27 With new mode matching solution in hand we began by installing it. We checked and corrected the position of L01 then took a look at the EOM. We put a spare EOM in the beam path (with no RF) and it did not distort the beam like the in-service one did. We then put the in-service EOM back in the beam path and sure enough it stretched the beam as we saw yesterday. Unsure if this is normal (I don't recall seeing this during installation back in 2021) but not knowing RF well enough to feel comfortable messing with it on a Sunday with almost no one onsite we decided to remove the EOM from the beam path continue with the mode matching install and talk to Fil on Monday. We got the mode matching solution installed and aligned and took a beam profile measurement. It took a few iterations but we were able to get a beam with an average waist size and position where it needs to be for the 4S-HP amplifier. Ultimately we had to move both L21 and L02 25mm away from the amplifier increase the distance between L21 and L02 by ~3 mm (we had shorted it during install the distance was supposed to by 86mm and we were at ~83mm) then move L01 away from the NPRO by 2.0mm. The results of our final Gaussian Fit: Horizontal Waist: 159.0 µm @ 1791.0 mm Vertical Waist: 172 µm @ 1797.0 mm Average: 165.6 µm @ 1794.2 mm Target: 165.0 µm @ 1794.0 mm We broke here for the day. Tomorrow we will talk to Fil about the RF so we can take a look at the spare EOM and will then continue with Amp1 recovery.

37287,H1 PSL - PSL NPRO Swap Day 4 (WP12155),https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=80885,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Fri, 25 Oct 2024 17:29:55 -0700","J. Oberling R. Short We continued on from yesterday . We started by rough aligning our beam through Amp1 in preparation for beam propagation measurements to assess how well we installed our mode matching solution. We had done a rough alignment previously so expected this to go quick but it was more off than I expected. We also checked our beam polarization going into FI01 (after WP01) and going into Amp1 (after WP02) using a temporary PBSC as an analyzer. The beam should be vertically polarized w.r.t. the table top in both locations. Going into FI01 the beam was definitely as vertically polarized as WP01. But after WP02 roughly 50% of the beam was in horizontal polarization (~50mW beam almost 24mW in horizontal polarization). This is not good and not how we left this after our PSL recover work in March of 2023 wrong polarization through the amplifiers has a large effect on output beam quality (as learned with the O3 70W amplifier). This immediately sent up red flags for us referencing our slowly increasing PMC Refl (increasing since March '24 we swapping the PMC in July because of this). Immediately we suspected something in FI01 was bad/broke/wrong and could have been for a while (if something in FI01 had been slowly failing and changing the output beam polarization while failing that would explain the slowly increasing PMC Refl as changing the beam polarization from vertical through the amps negatively affects their output beam quality). We have been using the old Faraday isolator from the 35W Front End laser but we have 2 spare Newport FIs identical to the one being used between the amplifiers. Unfortunately we only have one other FI pedestal base and it puts the FI at a 100mm beam height not 4"". We looked through all of the spare pedestal bases from the O4 laser upgrade hoping to find one like is used for FI02 (puts the beam height at 4"") but no other spare FI bases were found. We also measured the throughput of this Faraday at ~85% which is lower than the ~93% we had at install. Something here isn't right. While checking the FI mount situation out the alignment situation was bugging me so we took another look. Checking back through our alignment again we noticed it was off on our alignment iris in front of L02. So L21 and the EOM were removed and alignment checked again. The alignment was fine on our first iris but a little off on our second. M02 was tweaked to fix this then the EOM installed and its alignment tweaked. At a point where the EOM alignment looked good on our iris near L02 we decided to check power in and power out and found we were losing ~6mW through the EOM (this is at a lower alignment power of ~74mW). We put the power meter at the output of the EOM and adjusted the EOM alignment until the power out of it was maxed best we could do was ~70mW out with 74mW in. At this point we looked at the iris near L02 and the beam was a tiny bit high but for the most part looked OK so we moved on. L21 was reinstalled and its alignment tweaked. Now to deal with the Faraday but first lunch. After lunch we swapped the Faraday with one of the Newport spares. Since the pedestal base was a little too short we used a couple of shims under the Faraday to get it at the correct height. Without making any adjustments to the Faraday we checked the beam on our temporary PBSC still installed after WP02 and found almost no beam in transmission. With no changes to the waveplates or tweaking of the Faraday the beam was now much better vertically polarized lending credence to the theory that something had finally failed in the older Faraday we'd been using (we'll see if this was the source of our PMC Refl issue once we have the PMC up and running again). We tweaked the angle of the input PBSC on the Faraday to minmize the rejected beam lowest we could get was 0.40mW. We then flipped it around and tweaked the output PBSC to minimize the transmitted beam lowest we could get here was ~17µW we saw ~11µW once but we were unable to maintain this while clamping the output PBSC. Since we found this at ~55 µW we called it a win and moved on. The Faraday was flipped once again and we began setting up for beam propagation measurements. These measurements are done with a leakage beam through M03 so we installed a rail (we have blocks in place to make this easy) and set up the WinCam beam profiler. We then increased the power back to ~1.8W by rotating WP14. After a little bit figuring out the basics of Varun's script which we haven't ran since 2023 we were able to take one measurement before we called it for the day: Horizontal waist: 86µm @ 1774.0mm Vertical waist: 102µm @ 1766.0mm Average: 94µm @ 1770.1mm Our target is 165µm @ 1794.0mm so we have a little work to do here. We called it here for the day and will continue with mode matching tweaks and Amp1 recovery tomorrow.","{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80885,jason.oberling@ligo.org

The last time a full flush was done and not just refills from line leaks or chiller swaps was back in 2016 ( alog30017 ). This is notably much longer than the 6mo service interval the manufacturer recommends. Just like back then after turning off the lasers power supplies and AA chassis we disconnected all electrical and tried to drain the chillers to start. We struggled to get much out of the chiller via the drain pipe but a trickle would come out of the process input if the ball valve on the back of the chiller is set to a 45deg angle. After the chillers were mostly drained we tried to wipe the reservoirs to get out any junk that was in there. We then set up a hose with a quick connect and connected it to the process input line and ran it to a bucket below the mezzanine to avoid carrying large quantities of water down those stairs (see attachment 1 ). The process output was hooked up to the chiller then with two people on the mezzanine and one below to watch the bucket and hose we turned on a chiller and filled the reservoir as the level dropped. We put about 13 gal through the system for each before turning off the chiller which should be more than each system contains ( alog30638 ). Seperately I noticed while we were swapping the TCSY laser that some of the 1/4"" tubing connected to the RF driver felt softer than others also connected to it. Turns out 2 of the 8 connected to it are a different type - Tygon 2001 (softer) vs Tygon2475. According to a data sheet I found the 2001 has a max working pressure of 30psi compared to the 2475 max at 50psi. We should really think about replaing all of these lines post O4 but I'll need to look into how much pressue these lines actually have.

I think they should be. This is a drive from the blended input of the control loop (well several because it's in the EUL basis) to the signal seen on the GS-13 in the same EUL basis converted to displacement (so it will roll off below 30 mHz because the the realtime calibration of the GS-13s in displacement rolls off and it has a bump at 30 Hz because this is really the complementary sensitivity and that has a bump because of the servo bump) But it should be really close to 1 from 0.1 to 3 Hz. The rotational DOFs (right side red line) look pretty good but the translations (L V T) all show a similar non-unity response. Jim and Brian should discuss. They look similar to each other so maybe it's a blend which isn't quite complementary?

Oberling R. Short C. Compton T. Guidry J. Driggers Continuing from yesterday this morning Camilla and Ryan began First Contact cleaning the lenses for our chosen mode matching solution. I met with Tyler and he modded the spacer plates for us. Once that was done I went into the enclosure to begin building the new lens mount stack and place the rail for it. While in there also looked at exactly where on the table our new lens would be going. In checking this I found a discrepancy in the As Built layout the NPRO was placed in the wrong position 1/2"" back from where it's actually sitting. Seeing this I left the enclosure and re-ran the mode matching to account for this change in distance to Amp1's input beam waist location. The solution stayed the same but the lens locations changed slightly. I finished this as Ryan and Camilla were finishing up the lens cleaning and it was almost lunch time so we broke for lunch. After lunch Ryan and I went into the enclosure to start installing the mode matching lenses. While in the enclosure Jenne (from the CR) and Ryan worked to find the script that Varun wrote back during the '21 laser upgrade to quickly do a Gaussian fit to beam propagation measurements which will really speed up checking the results of our mode matching they found the script and it lives in /ligo/gitcommon/labutils/beam_scans. We then installed L01 an f = +222mm lens and recovered the beam alignment. With the new L01 in place we then re-installed the EOM and aligned it. Next was installing the new lens an f = -334mm lens now known as L21. We roughly placed it then used a scale to measure back from M03 to place it more accurately. It was at this point we discovered yet another discrepancy in the As Built layout I had not put the beam path from mirrors M03 and M04 on the correct row of holes which added 2"" to our NPRO to Amp1 distance. So once again we left the enclosure to take yet another look at mode matching (we have now discussed talking with CDS about getting JamMT on one or both of the computers in the Laser Room this requires an installation of the Java Runtime Environment) the lenses did not change but their positions did (as expected) see attached. This done we went back into the enclosure to install the last 2 lenses in the proper locations for our mode matching solution. We had to remove WP02 as L21 now sits where WP02 once did (not a big deal the position of WP02 is not critical). This done we installed L21 and aligned it during alignment we had to drive the lens to the furthest extent of the lens mount to align the beam which should not be the case if our M02 to M03 alignment was good. Turns out we were checking the alignment at a bad point beyond M03. M03 and M04 are used to align the beam into Amp1 so the beam won't be exactly on a row of holes there but the alignment jig we use (one of the tall posts with pinholes in it at beam height that we stick a power meter behind then adjust the optic being aligned until power is maxed) sit on a row of holes. By aligning L01 the EOM and L21 to a point beyond M03 we were steering the beam off of our previous M02 to M03 alignment. So we moved the alignment post to in front of M03 and re-aligned L01 the EOM and L21 things looked much better after that. Finally we installed and aligned the new L02 an f = +222mm lens.

37302,H1 ISC - PR2 and PR3 BOSEM coupling,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=80862,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 24 Oct 2024 17:59:45 -0700",This alog builds off of the work done by Joshua to measure PR2 and PR3 BOSEM coupling in alogs 80732 and 80814 . His injections showed that PR2 coupling to DARM occurs up to about 12 Hz and PR3 coupling up to 25 Hz. To note: these injections were performed above 10 Hz and the measurements were able to pick up some coupling between 7-10 Hz as well. However I think the most significant coupling and limitation of the BOSEMs likely occurs in the auxiliary controls below 5 Hz. There is some indication of that from these measurements. I used his injections to investigate the pathways of this coupling. I modeled my scripts after the scripts that Sheila has written previously to measure couplings to DARM through multiple pathways as in 80730 . I made two plots one showing each PR2 bosem contribution to DARM and one showing each PR3 bosem contribution to DARM . There is also a set of plots attached to this alog that show each PR2 and PR3 bosem coupling to DARM projected through MICH PRCL SRCL CHARD P and Y and PRC2 P and Y ( PR3 ASC PR3 LSC PR2 ASC PR2 LSC). Overall these results indicate that PR2 and PR3 coupling to DARM through ASC and LSC loops are fairly minimal. The PR2 and PR3 noise seems to show up most strongly in RF9 so there is strong coupling to PRCL and PRC2. I predict there is probably coupling to CARM especially for PR3. As a quick test I compared the LSC REFL RF9 Q error signals during the injection and saw coupling of the PR3 BOSEM noise up 30 Hz ( dtt screenshot where reference trace shows quiet time live trace is during the PR3 T2 BOSEM injection). As an example I projected the BOSEM noise to PRCL PR2 projection and PR3 projection (the result is uncalibrated). I think if we injected at even lower frequencies we would see that PRCL is greatly limited by this noise. If we would like to do further tests to investigate this coupling we should: inject at lower frequencies open the POP beam diverter to see the appearance of this noise on the POP WFS and move to 1 CARM sensor to see the appearance of this noise on an out-of-loop CARM sensor. The POP WFS test would help us understand if for example this excess noise on PR3 is causing some sort of jitter that couples to DARM. This would help further understand why PR3 BOSEM seems to couple strongly to DARM up to almost 30 Hz but only appears weakly in the auxiliary DOFs. However it is also important to finish investigating the contributions of all triple suspensions so PRM BS and all the SRC mirrors. I made all of these plots using the utils code from the aligoNB repository.

But given the current sign is actually better for DARM the model error doesn't really matter and it's not really worth changing signs. The wrong HD angle sign seems to be why none of our quantum noise models despite fitting all other SQZ angles well have ever fit FIAS properly. We will update our quantum noise models for the noise budget. Attached are some quantum noise models and DARM plots for Camilla's recent SQZ dataset lho80664 . Plots with optimal FDS (optimal fc detuning) for both signs of the homodyne angle: showing 1st just the quantum noise models without adding back non-quantum noise (NQN) and 2nd showing QN models + NQN. Current sign of DARM (+) has solid lines. ""Other"" sign (-) has dashed lines. Homodyne angle is only really obvious for FIAS (freq-indep anti-squeezing turqoise traces). It's almost indistinguishable for FIS otherwise (green yellow light blue). Marginally noticeable for FDS (but more sensitive to FC optimization). Sheila made a super important observation that FIAS has never fit quantum noise models properly. Quantum noise models with the ""other"" (-) sign expect FIAS < No SQZ between 15-100 Hz and FIAS < FIS between 15-50 Hz. This is not what we have observed with FIAS despite QN models fitting all other SQZ angles fine. Only flipping the HD angle sign was able to match the QN models to data suggesting that previous quantum noise models used the wrong sign of the homodyne angle. It turns out this doesn't really matter in real life but we will update the noise budget models. Confusingly the current (+) side is better with FDS but the ""other"" (-) side is better for unsqueezed DARM . See the grey (+) vs. black (-) traces for unsqueezed DARM at +/- 10 deg homodyne angles. Not sure where the notion of a ""good side of DARM"" comes from Pre-O4a there was a quick test to lock on the other side of DARM lho68080 ... But maybe this test just shows some technical noises change with the HD angle? In the test see the plot of how unsqueezed DARM (purple vs. red) is very different below 100 Hz for the two signs but not in the pway predicted by quantum noise models (grey + black traces) . So seems like this test suggests the +/- sign measured DARM noise differences are more likely technical (non-quantum) noises that change with homodyne angle. Third attachment ( 3rd ) shows a wider range of homodyne angles from +15 deg to -10 deg. So far the code for these plots is living here . --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Altogether this is making progress on the quantum noise models for the noise budget! Summarizing updates and what we're learning: As Sheila said low freq frequency-independent anti-squeezing (FIAS) ---> homodyne angle (which sign it is + approx how many degrees ): see light blue FIAS traces in 2nd plot . Elenna recently measured the contrast defect in lho80806 corresponding to a upper homodyne angle of +7.4 deg (down from the +10.7 deg measured in O4a ( lho71913 )). After subtraction FIS matches reasonably well with this lower HD angle +7 deg . Still +10.7 deg is only marginally different so FIAS is not really precise enough to tell at the ~degree level. As in lho80318 79951 can use the frequency-independent squeezing (+mid-sqz) bronchosaurus (FIS) ---> SRCL detuning. After subtraction FIS matches reasonably well with SEC detuning between 0 and -0.2 deg . Subtracted FDS data still WIP as the low frequency quantum noise estimate seems not totally right. Maybe could fit the FC detuning at each SQZ angle (as SQZ angle can affect the RLF-CLF offset for such low (sub-linewidth) FC detunings) but haven't thought about this FDS data much yet. Important model degeneracies remain from having 4 model unknowns: [[ IFO arm power + readout loss and SQZ NLG + injection loss ]] with which to fit 3 DARM measurements [[ unsqueezed shot noise + anti-squeezing (kHz level) + squeezing (kHz level) ]]. Still need to factor in mode-matchings. SQZ ","{'term': 'H1 SQZ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80820,victoriaa.xu@ligo.org

We've seen this happen in the past and I've written some wrapper functions to help with this - (userapps)/sys/h1/guardian/timeout_utils.py. While looking through the code with Sheila and Dave separately it definitely seems like this node has been edited a bit and has been left in an odd state in need of cleanup. So I: Removed the unnecessary counters and other unnecessary code in the CHECK_SHUTTER state Added the timeout function calls to the nds data request and some logic around it Changed the edges a bit for slightly better state flow Added a few more comments doc strings and notifications for clarity We also noticed that ISC_LOCK doesn't actually look directly at this node before powering up anymore. I looks like it was commented out in Dec 2018 for some SRY testing then never put back in. The node was still watched by the top level IFO node so it would still have stopped us from Observing as it was the case last week. I moved that bit of code to the AS_SHUTTERS state where we already check the FAST_SHUTTER node (this node runs a test on the shutter before power up vs LOCKLOSS_SHUTTER_CHECK will check if it fired during the last high power lock loss). This way we won't power up if there was no GS13 kick on the last high power lock loss. I tested the LOCKLOSS_SHUTTER_CHECK node by running it through the checks normally and with the value of the GS13 kick incredibly low so it would flag a failure. This node is loaded and ready and I reloaded ISC_LOCK with the new conditional in the AS_SHUTTERS state though I have no yet ran this state since we have no IFO right now.

37312,H1 SQZ - Initial beam profiling after GAOM1 (used for squeezer pump ISS),https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=80830,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 24 Oct 2024 09:58:40 -0700","Sheila Daniel Vicky On Tuesday Sheila and I took some beam profiles of the squeezer pump beam after the pump AOM used for ISS (GAOM1). This is trying to understand and fix the squeezer pump ISS issues that result from GAOM1 becoming misaligned on SQZT0. Summary and proposed plan: the vertical beam profile we measured looks reasonable the horizontal profile looks off (potentially related to measuring after the AOM). We could move GAOM1 closer to SHG by 1-2 holes to get closer to the beam waist of ~100um that is about 1.3m after SHG. While GAOM1 is out we could re-measure the horizontal beam profile to make sure it is OK. Here are plots of the pitch beam profiles we took before and the very quick a la mode plot code that adapts Sheila's and Georgia's previous codes. I think the vertical beam profiles we took line up with Georgia's previous measurements and D1201210 which both say there should be a waist like 1.25m - 1.3m after SHG. In real life we measured from z=0 at the EOM mount edge closest to GAOM1 to the face of the beam profiler (may need to take into account beam profile distance..). So it seems possible that GAOM1 is like 0.02-0.05 meters (~2 inches?) downstream of the waist. From photos and SQZT0 layout D1201210 there is room to try moving GAOM1 closer to L15 (closer to SHG) by 1-2 holes. At LLO ( example photo) GAOM1 misalignments are not a pump ISS problem - and their GAOM1 is also several holes closer to L15 than LHO's (which is what these profiles suggest to try). Kinda ignoring the horizontal beam profiles here since we measured after GAOM1 and the beam's yaw profile was not fitting well while measuring. The pump beam after GAOM1 looked kinda double-lobed with some smaller outer fringes even with the AOM drive at 0V where it should be ""passing everything"" and not diffracting but maybe there was some RF leakage.. The profiler's fitting function was fitting both lobes at once and being thrown off by the fringers so likely over-estimating the waist in yaw (blue). Worth checking the beam profile without the AOM in place. Useful DCC references: SQZT0 layout D1201210 and mode-matching document here : see pg.4 should be a waist of w0~100um at z~1.3m from SHG. SQZT0 Green AOMs for PUMP + FCGS paths: E2000561 . GAOM1 for pump ISS is M1250-P200L-0.75 a 200 MHz AOM with aperture of 0.75 mm. Updated +200MHz label on SQZT0 medm screen.

Short J. Oberling F. Clara Continuing from yesterday this morning Ryan and I looked at mode matching solutions and found one we liked see attached. It seems pretty robust in that we can have the lenses several mm off and still get >99.9% mode overlap (not easily seen in the picture as the other lens positions are off screen). Once the LVEA was transitioned to Laser Safe we went out to do the readback adjustments on the new NPRO. All of the adjustments were going well until we got to the Laser On/Off Monitor adjustment. For information on this particular adjustment see the file 'Some further information needed... .docx' in T1900456 . No matter how we adjusted the potentiometer we could not get the PSL Beckhoff software to recognize that the laser was on. We installed a 25-pin breakout board and looked at the voltage all we saw was 0.032 V. No matter how the pot was adjusted this value never moved but very occasionally jump up to a higher voltage (1.5 V to 2.5 V range). This looked like a connection problem so we took the power supply to the EE shop and enlisted Fil's help in figuring this out. We referenced what little wiring diagram info we had to carefully trace the signal path check the proper resistor was installed in R33 (4.7k it was correct) and made sure all the wiring had been done properly (it was). Fill cleaned some excess flux from around where the remote board picks off the signal it needs to detect if the laser is on or off (for future reference this is the top side of power supply resistor R1 for the ON signal and the left side (when looking at the vertically mounted circuit board from the inside) of component T11 for the OFF signal). He also didn't like the way the solder around remote board resistor R33 looked so he reflowed it. At this point he wanted to power it up so we plugged it in. Unfortunately the power supply interlocks itself if no laser is attached (as expected) so we took the power supply back out to the PSL racks and hooked it up to the laser (but not the Beckhoff system). A breakout board was hooked to Diagnostics port 2 and we turned on the power supply. With the laser off the pin read 0V (as it should) and with the laser on the pin read ~7V (yay!). So apparently either cleaning the flux or reflowing the solder fixed the connection problem. We then wired the power supply to the PSL Beckhoff system and tuned the correct potentiometer so the voltage was at the ~10V it should be. The software correctly detects when the laser is on when it is off and is capable of turning the laser on and off and all of the diagnostic readbacks are reading the correct values. At this point it was after 1pm so we broke for some lunch. After lunch we went in to the enclosure to begin recovering Amp1. With all of the lenses between the NPRO and Amp1 removed and the NPRO power turned down to ~85mW (using WP14) we roughly aligned the beam through Amp1. We had ~53mW incident on Amp1 and were able to get 2.38 mW in transmission. While this doesn't seem like much there are no lenses installed so the beam is overfilling the amp's entrance aperture and every optical element inside the amp so this is expected. When I had removed lens L02 it was a little stuck in its mount and when it came out I inadvertently put my thumb right on the surface. So time was spent getting the lens cleaned before storage. This done we then grabbed the lenses needed for our mode matching solution. Back in 2021 we had stored them with First Contact on them so we removed it. It left behind a large amount of residue on every surface so the lenses require cleaning again. As we do not have First Contact in the PSL enclosure we contacted Camilla about the location of more. Since neither Ryan nor I have worked with First Contact much Camilla offered to clean the lenses in the morning since it was already 4pm we took her up on that offer (Thank You!!!). We then began building the component stack needed to mount the third lens of the mode matching solution. Turns out when we installed this PSL confiuration back in 2021 we used all of the spacer blocks designed to put the lens at our 4"" beam height so all we had left were the old spacer blocks designed for a 100mm beam height. What we do have however is small 1.6mm spacers that could be used to get the height correct but they needed modified so they work with our larger spacer block. I contacted Tyler about doing this quick mod in the morning and he agreed (Thank You!!!). So on deck for tomorrow: Lens cleaning (Camilla) 1.6mm spacer mods (Tyler) Install mode matching solution align lenses take beam propagation measurements and do Gaussian fit to ensure mode matching is doing what we expect modify if it isn't Begin aligning through Amp1 and powering it up ","{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80854,jason.oberling@ligo.org

It does see a few occasional glitch-like features (see attachment) but they are (a) much less frequent than the old laser and (b) no more than 1/2 size. Another factor to consider is that overnight the PSL environmental controls were left on so this is a noisier environment than we normally have. Also no external servos (eg FSS) are engaged. I've tried to make the y-axis about the same as the orig laser (blue) plots from yesterday so that it's easier to see that these rare glitches are indeed much smaller than the ones on the old laser. EDIT: Sheila and I looked at this plot along with some others that Oli had created a few weeks ago and it looks like these small 'steps' in the power that are shown here may be of the same type that we had with the previous NPRO. I'm still hopeful that they are smaller and less frequent though.

Since the blue trace includes transients from the locklosses there isn't much of an apparent trend looking at this data without masking out locklosses. From the orange trace you can see that the maximum of the glitches that we have been riding out in low noise has gotten higher recently after drifting somewhat over the run. The next plot shows sort of a glitch rate where I've counted minutes where the FSS fast mon channel goes above 0.6 V as minutes with glitches and haven't made an attempt to try to count how many glitches are happening each minute. Aside: Thanks to Erik and Jonathan for helping me understand why Oli has been having a hard time getting data.

The lower left (bigger) wire is touching the 1/2-20 cap on the body of the shutter. How did this happen you might ask. A combination of a few factors. It's not great that the pins stick out so much from the peek connector. So the nominal pin configuration was to have both of the big pins on the right but the bobbin wire was not long enough for it. This was the case with the previous shutter as well and the old solution was to bend the pin 90 deg which we considered not great. When we left it there was a small space between the cable and the screw head we think because we harped for a bit over how to connect the pins given the interference. Now we realize that it's kinda easy for that cable to relax upwards with small tugs on the cable or even by itself or maybe in the dressing of the cable we moved it a bit and didn't check closely again. ,"{'term': 'L1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73709,anamaria.effler@ligo.org

37391,L1 General - Gravity Spy Glitch Rate Comparison for LLO and LHO between O3 and O4b,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=73703,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Wed, 23 Oct 2024 20:50:06 -0500",Abby Tejera Gabriela GonzalezSummary: We compared the glitch rate per hour in O3 and O4b for LHO and LLO respectively using Gravity Spy data. In LHO Extremely loud is the most common glitch type. Fast scattering has been relatively low for both detectors during O4b. ‘No glitch’ is one of the most common classifications in LHO. While LLO has duplicates in its O4b Gravity Spy data LHO does not.I looked at the available Gravity Spy machine learning algorithm data via LDVW for LLO and LHO in O4b and took data with a Gravity Spy confidence level equal to or greater than 90%. For each detector I compared its O4b data to its O3 data over the same period of time to compare the glitch rate per hour of each glitch class in both observing runs.I took all the O4b data from the start date of the observing run in 2024-04-10 till September and obtained the observing time for that entire period of time (LHO: ~1501 hours LLO: ~2592 hours) in order to get this rate.I did the same for O3 but with the information from the same months that we’ve been observing for O4b so far and I divided it by the observing time of that set of data (LHO: ~2456 hours LLO:~2618 hours) for O3.The results of this comparison for LHO and LLO are attached to this alog in a pdf. In LHO we observe that Extremely Loud is the most common glitch type which is something we had not seen before. Fast scattering during O4b has been relatively low for both detectors this is a big change particularly for LLO as fast scattering used to be one of its most common glitch types in O3.We observe that ‘No glitch’ is within one of the most common glitch classes in LHO but its glitch rate is similar to that of scattered light and low frequency lines so we suspect some of the glitches that are being classified as ‘no glitch’ might actually fall into one of these other two categories (which are additionally within the most common categories in LLO). We will look more into this.Additional notes: The Gravity Spy data for O3 has some duplicates (data corresponding to the same glitch/ GPStime) so when performing these comparisons we always check for any duplicates and eliminate those so that each glitch is considered once. When we did these comparisons for O4a we did not find any duplicates for that observing run. However now that we are performing these calculations for O4b we find duplicates in the Gravity Spy data for LLO. The same is not true for LHO. Because we are using Gravity Spy (the same machine learning algorithm) for our calculations for both detectors and as the duplicates show in LLO and not in LHO (which was not the case during O3) this leads us to suspect that the issue with the duplicates might not be an issue with the algorithm itself but rather something else might create this duplicated data that then is read and classified by Gravity Spy. We will continue to update this comparison as more Gravity Spy data becomes available and will share any updates on the points discussed in this alog.Detchar Non-image files attached to this report O3_O4b_glitch_comparison.pdf ,"{'term': 'L1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73703,abby.tejera@ligo.org

It is interesting that with the old day HEPI bias (different than current floating/locked position) the ITMX optic is in range and capable of going back to the recent locking position ( see figure attached ) ,"{'term': 'L1 SEI', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73688,huyen.pham@ligo.org

ITMY HEPI were unlocked yesterday. There were some ring-ups for both HEPI and ISI which I modified controls to get rid of. Performance is ok. The unlock moved ISI in favor of the ITMY optic (based on OPLEV readouts). The stops were back up in the order: pier 2-1-4-3 (horizontal stops first then vertical ones - H3 IPS had worst readout so it was saved for last). IPS sensor spectra looks ok - V1 is elevated at low frequency (see figure1 ). L4C V4 has low frequency noise but we skip this for now since only position loop will be used. Valve check looks ok ( 1st pdf ). Range of motion looks ok ( figure2 ). Linearity test looks mostly ok ( figure3 ) - could be better with symmetrizartion re-done. H3 and V2 linearity look weird most likely because of the actuators not being centered eventhough IPS readouts are in range. H3 can be explained further in the note below. HEPI ISO X and Y have ~10Hz instability so I reduce the Q as I did for ITMX HEPI. After that ISI RY have 155.5Hz ringings so I notch that in the RY control. The ITMY SEI is now controlled and table performance is comparable with other BSCs (see figure4 ). Note that ETMX RZ low-f elevation is believed caused by faulty GS13 H3 ( alog 70118 ). GV 1&2 were openned yesterday so I had OPLEV to monitor the optic position. The unlock gains ITMY optic range a bit ( figure5 ). Note : H3 IPS (24K counts before unlocking) were railed after HEPI unlocked so I had to move the IPS with one turn on the dial one turn CW (0.5mm?) at 10/22/2024 ~21:16UTC. This brought the H3 down to 17K . The actuator bellow on this pier was already in funny state - one bellow cover (far side) had been removed (see pic6 ). From H3 linearity test the fix maybe recenter the actuator.

For context the ALSY laser had maintenance early today and since then has been having either multimode locking issues or more general laser performance issues according to Daniel. To tackle this Keita and Tony lowered the ALSY locking thresholds in order to make it past ALS and while this worked once was not repeatable. Their alogs: alog 81116 alog 81114 . After some flailing I decided to call for help. Daniel came online and began to dianose the ALSY issues.

The final conclusion is that it's some tuning error where ALSY doesn't operate stably in its current frequency since being adjusted to PSL freq. Daniel's Alog 81117 .

In the past 6 hours good ALS locks (red trace near +1.0) are correlated with the lower green power states. At higher green p[owers we seem to be locking a intermediate transmitted powers indicating the possibility of a multimode laser. The second attached plot shows how changing the frequency of the laser changes the green and red powers.

Locked PMc and SHG took SQZ_OPO_LR to LOCKED (locks on GREEN) Adjusted temperature to maximum seed signal with OPO_IR_PD_LF_OUT got a bit confused here either went past the best temp or locked on a 2nd order mode. Toggle to CLF and re-optimize we got OPO_IR_PD_LF_OUT to ~200e-6 and CLF RF6 increased to -13. We then took SQZ_MANAGER to DOWN and FDS_READY_IFO. Got there with no issues we'll want to re-optimize the temperature right before we go to observing. Starting OPO temp: 31.25.

The first one is plugged into ports 45 & 6 on the PEM patch panel the second is plugged into ports 78 & 9. In the CER T3611670 is plugged into ports 2122 & 23 on PEM ADC5 and T3611672 is plugged into ports 2728 & 29 on PEM ADC4. In the DAQ these channels are H1:PEM-CS_ADC_5_{202122}_2K_OUT_DQ and H1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_{262728}_2K_OUT_DQ. So far the seismometers look like they are giving pretty good data similar to the STS and the old PEM Guralp in the biergarten. The seismometers are oriented so that the ""north"" marking on the their carry handles is pointed down the X-arm as best as I could with eyeballing it. I need to figure out the calibrations but it looks like there is almost exactly -15db difference between these new sensors and the old PEM Guralp but maybe the signal chain isn't exatly the same. Attached images compare the 3T's to the ITMY STS and the existing PEM Guralp in the biergarten. First image compares asds for each seismometer. Shapes are pretty similar below 40 hz but above that they all have very different responses. I don't know what the PEM guralp is calibrated to if anything it looks ~10x lower than the STS (which calibrated to nm/s). The 3T's are about 5x lower than the PEM sensor so ~50x lower than the STS. Second image are tfs for the XY & Z dofs between the 3T's and the STS. These are just passive tfs between the STS and 3T's to see if the have similar response to ground motion These are generally pretty flat between .1 and 10hz. The X & Y dofs seem pretty consistent the Z tfs are different starting around 10hz. I should go and check that the feet are locked and have similar extension. Third image are tfs between the 3T's and the exist PEM Guralp. Pretty similar to the tfs with the STS horizontal dofs all look very similar flat between .1 and 10hz but the ADC4 sensor has a different vertical response. I'll look at noise floors next.

38374,H1 PSL - PSL NPRO Crystal Temperature Tuning,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81107,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 14:38:21 -0800",V. Xu J. Oberling With the PSL NPRO still showing signs of mode hopping after consulting with Sheila via TeamSpeak it was decided to stop locking attempts and go out to the PSL racks to tune the NPRO crystal temperature to see if we could find a mode hop free region. I wasn't too familiar with what we were looking for here but Vicky is so she kindly agreed to lend a hand. We grabbed an oscilloscope from the EE shop some Lemo cables and adapters and out we went. We wanted to scan the PMC through a complete FSR so we could watch the mode content while we changed the NPRO crystal temperature. To do this we unplugged the DC cables for PMC Trans and Refl from the PSL Monitoring Fieldbox and plugged them into the oscilloscope. We also plugged a cable into the 50:1 HV monitor so we could trigger off of the PMC PZT ramp. For the ramp we used the Alignment Ramp on the PMC MEDM screen set to +/- 7V at 1 Hz. Once we got the signals on the scope and successfully triggered we clearly had a full FSR visible so we kept these ramp settings. We watched things for a little bit before starting adjustments and noticed the laser frequency drift a little bit Vicky estimated this at 1-3 GHz in 30 minutes. We began at the crystal temperature where we left it yesterday (25.2 °C) and used the temperature control on the FSS MEDM to step the temperature down. At ~24.85 °C we started to see clear mode hopping behavior in the scan which got worse at 24.75 °C see first attachment. We had originally set the crystal temperature to 24.7 °C so clearly we started in a mode hopping region. We continued moving the temperature down to see where the mode hop region ended the scan didn't start looking good again until ~24.5 °C. We continued moving the temperature down until we maxed the slider. This had the crystal temperature at 23.95 °C and we were still mode hop free. So we started moving the temperature up to start mapping out the upper region (>25.2 °C). When started seeing the bad mode hopping region right above 24.5 °C so this matches with where we saw things on the way down. However it didn't clear up until the temperature was >25.1 °C uncomfortably close to our starting value of 25.2 °C. It looks like the spot we locked the RefCav at yesterday was right on the edge of a mode hopping region and we had been slowly drifting in and out of it. We continued to move the temperature up via the MEDM slider unil it maxed at a crystal temperature of 25.49 °C and saw no mode hopping behavior. The second attachment shows some pictures from both of these good regions. The slider was maxed but we wanted to continue mapping the upper region especially as this area is closer to the operating temperature of the NPRO we just removed from the PSL (meaning the SQZ and ALS lasers had been happily locked in this area for all of O4 to date). To do this we set the slider back to 0 (a crystal temperature of ~24.7 °C) and used the knob on the front panel of the NPRO power supply to adjust the crystal temperature. We moved slowly while watching the power out of the amplifiers and NPRO in case the temperature adjustment caused beam changes that had a negative effect on amp output. In this way we moved the crystal temperature up to 26.75 °C and saw no mode hopping behavior. We did however start to see the power out of the amplifiers drop a little. At a crystal temperature of 26.75 °C we lost roughly 3 mW from the NPRO ~0.5 W from Amp1 and ~1 W from Amp2. 3 mW from the NPRO results in about 0.25 W lost at Amp2 so most of the loss is likely due to mode changes in the NPRO beam caused by the different operating temperature (if this was alignment we would have lost power a good bit faster mode matching changes I've observed are generally a good deal slower than alignment changes). Because of this we stopped here and set the crystal temperature to ~26.27 °C. Still had ~139.0 W output from Amp2 so all is well here. We then plugged everything back in and relocked the PMC it locked without issue. We then adjusted the crystal temperature down via the MEDM slider to find a RefCav resonance. We did have one time where the PMC unlocked when the PZT ran out of range (the PMC PZT moves to keep the PMC locked while the laser frequency changes). We couldn't see a 00 coming through on the PMC ramp so we moved the crystal temperature back up until a 00 was clearly visible flashing through at this point the PMC locked without issue. Continuing to move the temperature down we found a RefCav resonance flash through at a crystal temperature of 26.26 °C so we locked the RefCav. It took a couple of passes to grab the lock (had to disable the FSS Guardian to keep it from yanking the gains around) but it did lock. The final crystal temperature was 26.2 °C. To finish we locked the ISS grabbed our equipment and left the LVEA. We left things here for an hour and saw no signs of mode hopping again so Daniel and Vicky started tuning the ALS and SQZ lasers to match the new NPRO frequency. Time will tell whether or not we are in a better place in regard to NPRO mode hopping but results so far are promising. ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81107,jason.oberling@ligo.org

Once the ISS runs out of power available in the bank (because PMC Refl has increased so much the ISS has drained the bank to try to follow) it unlocks and relocks upone relock it still sees PMC Trans being low so drives the AOM diffraction down until it again runs out of range and unlocks. The cycle repeats until the mode competition stops and PMC Refl returns to its normal ~17.5W. This happened 3 times in 5 hours last night and was happening this morning when I arrived onsite. ,"{'term': 'H1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81099,jason.oberling@ligo.org

It's been a rough shift with issues relocking. Trouble with locking: We had a lockloss from CARM_5_PICOMETERS where it looked like something was being seen in FSS fastmon IMC-TRANS and the ISS_AOM_DRIVER channel for over a minute before the lockloss ( attachment1 )(maybe this is normal and alwys happens during this state?). After this the FSS would not let the IMC lock. There would be giant FSS oscillations in the fastmon channel while PSL_FSS moved between READY_FOR_MC_LOCK and FSS_OSCILLATING ( attachment2 ). Even after it stopped oscillating there were a few quick glitches that were also seen in the IMC ( attachment3 ). Tagging PSL Not completely sure if this is related to the PSL/IMC issues but while running an initial alignment we couldn't get past MICH_BRIGHT_ALIGN and IMC-MC2_TRANS_SUM looked like attachment4 . IMC-TRANS and FSS_FASTMON were oscillating but I'm not sure if that's happening as the issue or as a response to something else. Tagging PSL again sorry :( To solve the problem I took the detector out of initial alignment and waited for everything to calm down (the beamspots and table on the PSL cameras were going crazy) and then continued the IA once that had settled. When we got to ENGAGE_DRMI_ASC/the end of PREP for DRMI before I ran the initial alignment the beam spots on AS AIR would be shaking and the beamsplitter would start saturating and we would either unlock DRMI or lose the lock. I tried adjusting SRM because we were getting through PRMI fine but it just seemed to make it worse so I ran an initial alignment. After that we got up fine without the shaking but after the next lockloss we started having the shaking/saturations again so I ran another initial alignment. No shaking/saturations this time in ENGAGE_DRMI_ASC. Tagging ISC Good news is that we haven't had the new AS AIR PD( 81080 ) PEM-CS_ADC_5_19_2K_OUT_DQ saturate during the last three locklosses! The highest number of counts we've gotten have been around 16k counts. I have also put in a feature request for the integral of the channel's peak at lockloss to be calculated and put onto the lockloss pages and assigned it to me ( Issue#223 ).

OPO TEC temperature adjusted from 31.468 C --> 31.290 C to maximize seed NLG. Change is consistent with last time lho80926 (though not obvious that laser freq changes mean the red/green opo co-resonance should change but ok). Squeezer laser was likely modehopping at the new settings above . Symptoms: - Screenshot of TTFSS beatnote before / after / afterAfter the PSL laser freq change. - PMC_TRANS was 430 (nominal H1:SQZ-PMC_TRANS_DC_POWERMON~675) - PMC_REFL was 370 (nominal H1:SQZ-PMC_REFL_DC_POWERMON~44) - Bad PMC transmission meant not enough SHG power and while OPO could lock the OPO PUMP ISS could not reach the correct pump power. So aside from mode hopping being bad it would have meant bad squeezing. Camilla and I went to the floor. SQZ Laser controller changes made to avoid mode hopping: SQZ Laser current 1.935 A --> 1.885 A SQZ Laser crystal temp 27.02 C --> 27.07 C This adjustment seemed quite sensitive to laser current and crystal temperature with a tunable range kinda less than I expected. Compared to previous SQZ laser adjustments to avoid mode-hopping (see old laser 51238 51135 49500 49327 ) this temperature adjustment seems small for the current (amps) adjustment.. but seemed to work. PMC cavity scans look clean at these new settings (laser looks single-mode) see screenshot . For +/- 200 MHz steps of crystal frequency still see a 160 MHz beatnote.

PD output goes to H1:PEM-CS_ADC_5_19_2K_OUT_DQ for now. GiGE used to receive ~40ppm of the power coming into HAM6. I replaced the steering mirror in front of GigE with 90:10 the camera now receives ~36ppm and the beam going to the photodiode is ~4ppm. But I installed ND1.0 in front of the PD so the actual power on PD is ~0.4ppm. See the attached cartoon (1st attachment) and the picture (2nd attachment). Details: Replaced the HR mirror with 90:10 splitter (BS1-1064-90-1025-45P) roughly kept the beam position on the camera and installed a Thorlabs PDA520 (Si detector ~0.3AW) with OD1.0 absorptive ND filter in the transmission. I set the gain of PDA520 to 0dB (transimpedance=10kOhm). Reflection of the GigE was hitting the mirror holder of 90:10 so I inserted a beam dump there. The beam dump is not blocking the forward-going beam at all (3rd attachment). Reflection of the ND filter hits the black side panel of the enclosure. I thought of using a magnetic base but the enclosure material is non-magnetic. Angling the PD to steer the reflection into the beam dump for GigE reflection is possible but takes time (the PD is in a inconvenient location to see the beam spot). Fil made a custom cable to route power and signal through the unused DB9 feedthrough on the enclosure. Pin 1 = Signal Pin 6 = Signal GND Pin 4 = +12V Pin 5 = -12V Pin 9 = power GND. (However the power GND and signal GND are connected inside the PD.) All pins are isolated from the chamber/enclosure as the 1/2"" metal post is isolated from the PD via a very short (~1/4""?) plastic adapter.

There's a power jump in the NPRO output power (while the FSS was glitching but likely unrelated) followed by a dip in NPRO power that lines up with a ~2W increase in PMC reflected power likely indicating a mode hop. This power excursion was too much of a change out of the PMC for the ISS so the ISS lost lock. Since then there have been small power excursions (up to around 18-19W) but nothing large enough to cause the ISS to give out. As Jason mentioned I've edited the range of ISS diffracted power checked by DIAG_MAIN to be between 2.5% and 5.5% as we'll be running with the ISS at around 4% at least for now. I also checked with Daniel on how to adjust the secondloop tuning to account for this change and he advised that the ISS_SECONDLOOP_REFERENCE_DFR_CAL_OFFSET should be set to be the negative value of the diffracted power percentage so I changed it to be -4.2 and accepted it in SDF.

38407,H1 PSL - PSL Instability Since NPRO Swap,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81073,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Tue, 05 Nov 2024 12:58:45 -0800","R. Short J. Oberling Today we were originally planning to take a look at the TTFSS but noticed something before going into the enclosure that we think is the cause of some of the PSL instability since the completion of the NPRO swap. We were looking at some trends from yesterday's ISS OFF test recreating the plots Ryan C. had made when we noticed the ISS get angry and enter into an unlock/relock cycle that it couldn't get out of. While it was doing this we saw that the PMC Refl power was up around 40W 30W and ""breathing"" with PMC Trans as PMC Refl would increase PMC Trans would decrease but the sum of the 2 was unchanged. We then unlocked the ISS. As we sat and watching things for a bit after the ISS unlock we saw that PMC Refl would change by many Watts as it was breathing. We tried unlocking the IMC the behavior was unchanged we then tried unlocking the FSS RefCav and the behavior was still unchanged. It was at this point we noticed that the moves in PMC Refl were matched by very small moves (1-2 mW) in the NPRO output power as the NPRO output power went up PMC Refl went down and vice versa. This looked a whole lot like the NPRO was mode hopping and 2 or more modes were competing against each other. This would explain the instability we've seen recently. The ISS PDs are located after the PMC so any change in PMC output (like from competing modes) would get a response from the ISS. So if PMC Refl would go up as we had been seeing and PMC Trans drops in response also as we had been seeing the ISS would interpret this as a drop in power and reduce the ISS AOM diffraction in response. When the ISS ran out of range on the AOM diffraction it would then become unstable and unlock it would then try to lock again see it ""needed"" to provide more power run out of range on the AOM and unlock. While this is happening the FSS RefCav TPD would get very noisy and drop as power out of the PMC was dropping. You can see it doing this in the final 3 plots from the ISS OFF test. To give the ISS more range we increased the power bank for the ISS by moving the ISS Offset slider from 3.3 to 4.1 this moved the default diffraction % from ~3% to ~4%. We also increased the ISS RefSignal so when locked the ISS is diffracting ~6% instead of ~2.5%. To try to fix this we unlocked the PMC and moved the NPRO crystal temperature via the FSS MEDM screen to a different RefCav resonance to see if the mode hopping behavior improved. We went up 2 RefCav resonance and things looked OK so we locked the FSS here and then the ISS. After a couple minutes PMC Refl began running away higher and the ISS moved the AOM lower in response until it ran out of range and unlocked. With the increased range on the diffracted power it survived a couple of these excursions but then PMC Refl increased to the point where the ISS emptied its power bank again and unlocked. So we tried moving down by a RefCav resonance (so 1 resonance away from our starting NPRO crystal temperature instead of 2) and it was the same: things looked good locked the stabilization systems and after a couple minutes PMC Refl would run away again (again the ISS survived a couple of smaller excursions but then a large one would empty the bank and unlock it again). So we decided to try going up a 3rd resonance on the RefCav. Again things looked stable so we locked the FSS and ISS here and let it sit for a while. After almost an hour we saw no runaway on PMC Refl so we're going to try operating at this higher NPRO crystal temperature for a bit and see how things go (we went 2 hours with the ISS OFF yesterday and saw nothing so this comes and goes at potentially longer time scales). The NPRO crystal temperature is now 25.2 °C (it started at 24.6 °C) and the temperature control reading on the FSS MEDM screen is now around 0.5 (it was at -0.17 when we started). We have left the ISS Offset at 4.1 and have moved the RefSignal so it is diffracting ~4% this to give the ISS a little more range since we've been seeing it move a little more with this new NPRO (should the crystal temperature change solve the PMC Refl runaway issue we could probably revert this change but I want to keep it a little higher for now). Ryan S. will edit DIAG_MAIN to change the upper limit threshold on the diffracted power % to clear the ""Diffracted power is too high"" alert and Daniel Vicky and Camilla have been re-tuning the SQZ and ALS lasers to match the new PSL NPRO cyrstal temperature. Also the ISS 2nd loop will have to be adjusted to run with this higher diffracted power %. Edit: Corrected the initial high PMC Refl from 40W to 30W. We saw excursions up towards 50W later on as can be seen in the plots Ryan posted below.","{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81073,jason.oberling@ligo.org

IMC/EX Rail/Non-Lockloss Lockloss Investigation: In this order and according to the plots this is what I believe happened. I believe EX saturated prompting IMC to fault while guardian was in DRMI_LOCKED_CHECK_ASC (23:17 PT) putting guardian in a weird fault state but keeping it in DRMI without unlocking (still a mystery). Ryan C noticed this (23:32 PT) and requested IMC_LOCK to DOWN (23:38 PT) tripping MC2’s M2 and M3 (M3 first by a few ms). This prompted Guardian to call me (23:39 PT). What is strange is that even after Ryan C successfully put IMC in DOWN guardian was unable to realize that IMC was in DOWN and STAYED in DRMI_LOCKED_CHECK_ASC until Ryan C requested it to go to INIT. Only after then did the EX Saturations stop. While the EX L3 stage is what saturated before IMC I don’t know what caused EX to saturate like this. The wind and microseism were not too bad so this could definitely be one of the other known glitches happening before all of this causing EX to rail. Here’s the timeline (Times in PT) 23:17: EX saturates. 300ms later IMC faults as a cause of this. 23:32: Ryan C notices this weird behavior in IMC lock and MC2 and texted me. He noticed that IMC lost lock and faulted but that this didn’t prompt an IFO Lockloss. Guardian was still at DRMI_LOCKED_CHECK_ASC but not understanding that IMC is unlocked and EX is still railing. 23:38: In response Ryan C put IMC Lock to DOWN which tripped MC2’s M3 and M2 stages. This called me. I was experiencing technical issues logging in so ventured to site (made it on-site 00:40 UTC). 00:00: Ryan C successfully downed IFO by requesting INIT. Only then did EX stop saturating. 00:40: I start investigating this weird IMC fault. I also untrip MC2 and start an initial alignment (fully auto). We lose lock at LOWNOISE_ESD_ETMX seemingly due to large sus instability probably from the prior railing since current wind and microseism aren’t absurdly high. (EY IX HAM6 and EX saturate). The LL tool is showing an ADS excursion tag. 03:15: NLN and OBSERVING achieved. We got to OMC_Whitening at 02:36 but violins were understandably quite high after this weird issue. Evidence in plots explained: Img 1: M3 trips 440ms before M2. Doesn’t say much but was suspicious before I found out that EX saturated first. Was the first thing I investigated since it was the reason for call (I think). Img 2: M3 and M2 stages of MC2 showing IMC fault beginning 23:17 as a result of EX saturations (later img). All the way until Ryan C downs IMC at 23:38 which is also when the WD tripped and when I was called. Img 3: IMC lock faulting but NOT causing ISC_LOCK to go to lose lock. This plot shows that guardian did not put IFO in DOWN or cause it to lose lock. IFO is in DRMI_LOCKED_CHECK_ASC but IMC is faulting. Even when Ryan C downed the IMC (which is where the crosshair is) this did not cause a ISC to go to DOWN. The end time axis is when Ryan C put IFO in INIT finally causing a Lockloss and ending the railing in EX (00:00). Img 4: EX railing for 42 minutes straight from 23:17 to 00:00. Img 5: Ex beginning to rail 300ms before IMC faults. Img 6: EX L2 and L3 OSEMs at the time of the saturation. Interestingly L2 doesn’t saturate but before the saturation there is erratic behavior. Once this noisy signal stops L3 saturates. Img 7: EX L1 and M0 OSEMs at the time of the saturation zoomed in. It seems that there is a noisy and loud signal (possibly a glitch or due to microseism?) in the M0 stage that is very short which may have kicked off this whole thing. Img 8: EX L1 and M0 OSEMs at the whole duration of saturation. We can see the moves that L1 took throughout the 42 minutes of railing and the two kicks when the railing started and stopped. Img 9 and 10: An OSEM from each stage of ETMX including one extra from M0 (since signals were differentially noisy). Img 9 is zoomed in to try to capture what started railing first. Img 10 shows the whole picture with L3’s railing. I don’t know what to make of this. Further investigation: See what else may have glitched or lost lock first. Ryan C’s induced lockloss saving the constant EX railing doesn’t seem to show up under the LL tool so this would have to be done in order of likely suspects. I’ve never seen this behavior before what this was if anyone else has.

38427,H1 ISC - Calibrated H1/L1 PRCL and MICH coupling comparisons,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81051,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Mon, 04 Nov 2024 13:29:17 -0800",This alog is a continuation of previous efforts to correctly calibrate and compare the LSC couplings between Hanford and Livingston. Getting these calibrations right has been a real pain and there's a chance that there could still be an error in these results. These couplings are measured by taking the transfer function between DARM and the LSC CAL CS CTRL signal. All couplings were measured without feedforward. The Hanford measurements were taken during the March 2024 commissioning break. The Livingston MICH measurement is from Aug 29 2023 and the PRCL measurement from June 23 2023. As an additional note during the Hanford MICH measurement both MICH and SRCL feedforward were off. However for the Livingston MICH measurement SRCL feedforward was on. For the PRCL measurements at both sites both MICH and SRCL feedforward were engaged. Results: The first plot attached shows a calibrated comparison between the MICH PRCL and SRCL couplings at LHO. The second plot shows a calibrated comparison between the Hanford and Livingston MICH couplings. I also included a line indicating 1/280 an estimated coupling level for MICH based on an arm cavity finesse of 440. Both sites have flat coupling between about 20-60 Hz. There is a shallow rise in the coupling above 60 Hz. I am not sure if that's real or some artifact of incorrect calibration. The Hanford coupling below 20 Hz has steeper response which appears like some cross coupling between SRCL perhaps (it looks about 1/f^2 to me). Maybe this is present because SRCL feedforward was off. The third plot shows a calibrated comparison between the Hanford and Livingston PRCL couplings. I have no sense of what this coupling should look like. If the calibration here is correct this indicates that the PRCL coupling at Hanford is about an order of magnitude higher than Livingston. Whatever coupling is present has a different response between both sites so I don't really know what to make of this. Calibration notes: The Hanford measurements used H1:CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ and the darm calibration from March 2024 ( /ligo/groups/cal/H1/reports/20240311T214031Z/deltal_external_calib_dtt.txt ) The Livingston measurement used L1:OAF-CAL_DARM_DQ and a darm calibration that Dana Jones used in her previous work ( 74787 saved in /ligo/home/dana.jones/Documents/cal_MICH_to_DARM/L1_DARM_calibration_to_meters.txt) LHO MICH calibration: I updated the CAL CS filters to correctly match the current drive filters. However I made the measurement in March 11 before catching some errors in the filters. I incorrectly applied a 200:1 filter and multiplied by sqrt(1/2) when I should have multipled by sqrt(2) ( 76261 ). Therefore my calibration includes a 1:200 filter and a factor of 2 to appropriately compensate for these mistakes. Additionally my calibration includes a 1e-6 gain to convert from um to m and an inverted whitening filter [100 100:1 1]. This is all saved in a DTT template: /ligo/home/elenna.capote/LSC_calibration/MICH_DARM_cal.xml LLO MICH calibration: I started with Dana Jones' template ( 74787 ) and copied it over into my directory: /ligo/home/elenna.capote/LSC_calibration/LLO_MICH.xml. I inverted the whitening filter using [100100100100100:11111] and applied a gain of 1e-6 to convert um to m. LHO PRCL calibration: I inverted the whitening using [100100:11] and converted from um to m with 1e-6. LLO PRCL calibration: I inverted the whitening using [101010:111] and converted from um to m with 1e-6. I exported the calibrated traces to plot myself.

Short I've updated the PSL_FSS Guardian so that it won't jump into the FSS_OSCILLATING state whenever there's just a quick glitch in the FSS_FAST_MON_OUTPUT channel. Whenever the FSS fastmon channel is over its threshold of 0.4 the FSS_OSCILLATION channel jumps to 1 and the PSL_FSS Guardian responds by dropping the common and fast gains to -10 dB then stepping them back up to what they were before. This is meant to catch when there's a servo oscillation in the FSS but it's also been happening when the FSS glitches. Since moving the gains around makes it difficult for the IMC to lock the Guardian should now only do that when there's an actual oscillation and should save time relocking the IMC.

When I found it the SQZ angle (as controlled by H1:SQZ-CLF_RF6_PHASE_PHASEDEG) was railed at 268 deg whereas normally the RF6 demod phase is around 195 degrees. Because the known SQZ angle to ASC coupling the ADF Angle servo running away could likely cause ASC to run away which causes LO loop not to lock and then FC-IR can't lock. Ryan cleared ASC as he described above TO-DO for us next week: We should clean up what the SQZ ASC clearing does. First I manually walked ZM6 P/Y to get some signal on OMC RF3 TRANS (manually walked the RF3_MON up from -22 to -10 or so). Then I was able to lock the LO loop (LO loop was railing when SQZ ASC had it totally misaligned). Then I manually enabled SQZ AS42 ASC and it worked to align ZM4/6 to maximize RF3_MON. I then adjusted OPO temperature to optimize RF6_ABS see screenshot . Here I just wanted to make sure the OPO temperature being wrong did not cause the SQZ angle to be wrong which in turn could've caused ASC to run away. After locking the LO loop then SQZ_MANAGER to FREQ_DEP_SQZ worked and SQZ_FC locked successfully. But FC ASC did not turn on because FC was misaligned (the issue described above). I manually lowered FC ASC trigger threshold (FC_ASC screen > TRIG: I lowered H1:SQZ-FC_ASC_TRIGGER_THRESH_ON from nominal 3 to 1.5) in order to force FC_ASC to turn on and align FC1 and FC2 for us. Then I reverted the SDF's on FC_INJ_ANG_{GAINTRAMP} which (I didn't realize) then applied the FC_ASC offsets stored in the filter bank histories to ZM3. This was good actually. Restoring this ZM3 alignment restored the FC_REFL power. Then all SDF's were clear and Ryan could go to observe. ,"{'term': 'H1 SQZ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81030,victoriaa.xu@ligo.org

In order to better see the values around high coherence we are plotting 1 - coherence and using a logarithmic scale. So to the left higher coherence and to the right lower coherence.There are two plots in each PDF for coherences with CALIB_STRAIN (left plots) and CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN (right plots).Each plot shows for each channel the coherence value before the broadening (black circles) and after (red diamonds) using the same 2h intervals as the plots from Wednesday and fftlength 64 s.Note that due to the ""M"" behaviour explained in the previous comment most channels in the GDS-CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN 60 Hz peak before the broadening have higher coherence surrounding 60 Hz than just at 60 Hz.What we observe is that most channel have a similar coherence value with some exceptions but there is no 1 channel with a much higher coherence than the rest.

What we have done is the following: - We have chosen 2 hour length data segments before and after the 60 Hz broadening for both detectors. For Livingston this is 10:00–12:00 Sept 17th vs 2:30–4:30 Sept 18. For Hanford 2:00–4:00 Oct 1st vs 8:00–10:00 Oct 2nd. - Then we launched FscanDriver with fftlenght 64s of these data segments in order to obtain Coherence and AMP PSD (not normalized) data to plot. The channels that we have analysed are the MAG channels plus the nine MAINSMON channels. Both for Livingston and Hanford. The coherence has been computed with both H1(L1):GDS-CALIB_STRAIN and H1(L1):GDS-CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN - With the data we have made 3 plots for each channel. The first one shows the coherence before and after of the channel with H1:GDS-CALIB_STRAIN the second the coherence before and after with H1:GDS-CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN and the third one the AMPPSD before and after the broadening.The conclusions are as follows: - The changes we see in AMPPSD do not seem to be large. However we see larger shoulders afterwards in the following channels (attaching the plots): - H1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_INPUTOPTICS_X Y Z_DQ - H1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_VERTEX_Y_DQ changing while the X and Z do not. - L1_PEM-EY_MAG_VEA_FLOOR_X Y Z_DQ - The coherence plots with GDS-CALIB_STRAIN don't show much difference before and after. - The coherence plots with GDS-CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN do show a large difference before and after. Before the broadening in both detectors there is an ""M"" in the shape of the coherence with a valley at 60 Hz and large shoulders at each side. These shoulders seem much broader in L1 than in H1. In the after broadening however this valley and shoulders appear to have disappeared. This appears to be because in the after plots the broadening cloaks the coherence with the shoulders. Furthermore these shoulders appear in the GDS-CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN and not the GDS-CALIB_STRAIN indicating that the calibration has caused coherence with the shoulders that is not there before calibration.Attaching some representative plots plus the channels mentioned above.

38525,L1 General - Observations for the very loud glitches are consistent with a scatterer near the ERM PDs,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=73865,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Sun, 03 Nov 2024 16:55:23 -0600",[Tabata Gaby] We used the correlation found by OmegaScan between CALIB_STRAIN and the ERM PDs for loud glitches to see whether the glitches are seen by PD in both arms just one or neither. We had observed that according to OmegaScan there were more photodiodes (PDs) in the y-arm than in the x-arm showing larger correlations ( alog 73447 ). However some large correlation values had also large standard deviations. We modified the OmegaScan analysis from comparing correlations between the x and y arm ERM PDs to correlation divided by standard deviation. With this we can conclude that 70% of the DARM glitches with large SNR (> 300) were found to be predominantly correlated with either the X arm or the Y arm. In most cases at least three PDs showed correlations. In contrast most of those with lower SNR exhibited no correlation with any arm. Figure 1 presents correlation/standard deviation versus glitch number with the glitches sorted by SNR in descending order meaning glitch #0 has the largest SNR (~12000) while glitch #199 has the lowest (~182). The horizontal line in the image represents the threshold established for indicating correlation. We also found instances of correlation involving both arms. After analyzing these cases we noted that one arm exhibited a significantly lower SNR compared to the other. Upon examining their raw time series we observed that signals from the photodiodes in the high-SNR arm exhibited a spike in their signal (indicating more light on the PD) while those in the other arm showed a slight decrease of light. This is consistent with a scatterer near the ERM PDs in one arm producing the spike with the loud glitch in DARM causing a minor power drop in both arms which manifests as a small decrease in the other arm’s PDs (and in the transmission monitors PDs as well). An example can be seen in Figure 2 where there is a spike in the signal in Y-arm PD and a decrease in X-arm PD. Signals were high-passed with a 3 Hz corner frequency.

The 300 gain shows double the contributions as the 600 around 9hz. This may be because the code normalizes the contributions based on the injections. Since this strange 9Hz seem to be comming from another source than the injections it got halved in the 600 plot in comparison to the 300.

Both of this and the previous lockloss look PSL-related (ie upstream of IMC- which does see power fluctuations earlier than suggested by the IMC_TRANS channel). Might be worth trying whether the IMC can stay locked with the ISS_ON vs. ISS_OFF tests again now that the PSL laser is not obviously mode hopping. This lockloss maybe looks strange: see 20-ms trends 1-second trends 5-second trends. It looks like a very fast lockloss (< 1ms) coincident with various FSS/ISS/TPD glitches - is this different than what we saw before? Here AS port loses light within like < 1 ms (as witnessed on Keita's new lockloss monitor AS_A and LSC-REFL which sees some corresponding power increase). Lockloss looks within 1ms of changes in PSL-FSS TPD FAST_MON PC_MON and ISS AOM SECONDLOOP etc. Weirdly IMC-TRANS_IN1_DQ (fast channel 16k) does not see power change until 5 ms later which I don't understand? I think like DARM loses lock (which should be why AS port and LSC-REFL both change inversely right?) while the power on IMC-TRANS doesn't change despite the PSL FSS and ISS loops all see glitches. Daniel suggested maybe there could be some more analog filtering on IMC-TRANS slows down this channel (even though it is recorded at 16k?) - we're not sure why there is such a delay and whether this IMC-TRANS channel a super reliable timing metric for what is happening. The ~5ms seems too fast for the storage time given IMC's ~8.8 kHz cavity pole (1/(2*pi*8.8kHz) ~ 18 microseconds). Daniel helped add some fast PSL-ISS_SECONDLOOP channels to the Sheila's scopes and I've added Keita's lockloss monitor channel too ( 81080 H1:PEM-CS_ASC_5_19_2K_OUT_DQ ) then saved this scope at /ligo/home/victoriaa.xu/ndscope/PSL/PSL_lockloss_search_fast_iss.yaml Lockloss ,"{'term': 'H1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81155,victoriaa.xu@ligo.org

Camilla and I checked this out today and it turns out that these locklosses are actually from LOCKING_ARMS_GREEN - the checker in READY that is supposed to make sure the IMC is locked was actually written as nodes['IMC_LOCK'] == 'LOCKED' (line 947) which just checks that the requested state for IMC_LOCK is LOCKED and it doesn't actually make sure the IMC is locked. So READY will return True it will continue to LOCKING_ARMS_GREEN and immediately lose lock because LOCKING_ARMS_GREEN actually makes sure the IMC is locked. This all happens so fast that verbals doesn't have time to announce LOCKING_ARMS_GREEN before we are taken to DOWN. To (hopefully) solve this problem we changed nodes['IMC_LOCK'] == 'LOCKED' to be nodes['IMC_LOCK'].arrived and nodes['IMC_LOCK'].done and this should make sure that we stay in READY until the IMC is fully locked.

It seems that the fast shutter after it was shut bounced down to momentarily unblock the AS beam at around the time the power peaked. For this specific lock loss the energy deposited into HAM6 was about 17J and the energy that got passed the fast shutter is estimated to be ~12J because of the bouncing. Bouncing motion was known to exist for some time (e.g. alogs 79104 and 79397 the latter has an in-air slow-mo video showing the bouncing) it seems as if the self damping is not working. Could this be an electronics issue or mechanical adjustment issue or something else? Also if we ever open HAM6 again (before this fast shutter is decomissioned) it might be a good idea to make the shutter unit higher (shim?) so the beam is still blocked when the mirror reaches its lowest position while bouncing up and down. Details: The top panel shows the newly installed lockloss power monitor (blue) and ASC-AS_A_DC_NSUM which monitors the power downstream of the fast shutter (orange). The shutter was triggered when the power was ~3W or so at around t~0.36 and the ASC-AS_C level drops by a factor of ~1E4 immediately ( FS mirror spec is T<1000ppm seems like it's ~100ppm in reality). However 50ms later at t~0.41 or so the shutter bounced back down and stayed open for about 15ms. Unfortunately this roughly coincided with the time when the power coming into HAM6 reached its maximum of ~760W. Green is a rough projection of the power that went to OMC (aka ""AS_A_DC_NSUM would have looked like this if it didn't rail"" trace). This was made by simply multiplying the power mointor itself with AS_A_DC_NSUM>0.1 (1 if true 0 if false) ignoring the 2nd and 3rd and 4th bouncing. All in all for this specific lock loss the energy coming to HAM6 was 16~17J and the energy that got past FS was about 11~12J because the timing of the bounce VS the power. OMC seems to be protected by the PZT though see the 2nd attachemt with wider time range The time scale of the lock loss spike itself doesn't seem that different from the L1 lock loss in LLO alog 73514 where the power coming to HAM6 peaked tens of ms after AS_A/B/C power appreciably increased. OMC DCPDs might be OK since they didn't record crazy high current (though I have to say the IN1 should have been constantly railing once we started losing lock which makes the assessment difficult) and since we've been running with bouncy FS and the DCPDs have been good so far. Nevertheless we need to study this more. ISC ","{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81130,keita.kawabe@ligo.org

We followed the procedure in LIGO-T1400486 to test the performance of the OFS board and everything seemed normal. We centered the beam on the OFS PD in the transmitter module and used the REFL output beam on the PS4 (WSH) power standard to set the loop offset to 3.94 V (V2 on the HP power supply)which gave 300 mW in the REFL beam. We then measured the OFS OLTF (Souce at CLTF TEST IN PD MON / ERR MON) and set the gain at 7.60 V (V1 on the HP power supply) to give a UGF of 100 kHz. The phase margin is about 55 deg as expected.

So far it looks like: This problem is distinct from the 60 Hz broadening due to issues with line subtraction (this noise feature shows up in DELTAL_EXTERNAL). CS microphone and accelerometer channels look suspicious particularly H1:PEM-CS_MIC_LVEA_BS_DQ but the noise shows up earlier there than in DARM. If it is the same noise something must have changed with the coupling during the break. The attached plots are all generated from Fscan weekly and monthly averaged data. The feature can be seen most clearly in these long-duration spectra. Fig 1: Comparison of October monthly spectra STRAIN_CLEAN vs DELTAL_EXTERNAL. The location of interest is marked with a vertical pink line (this marker is actually too narrow just showing general location). The 60 Hz broadening described in 80624 mostly hides the bump in STRAIN_CLEAN but it's still evident in DELTAL_EXTERNAL. Fig 2: Comparison of spectrograms made from weekly averages STRAIN_CLEAN vs DELTAL_EXTERNAL. The region of interest is circled in red. This seems consistent with the timeline Keith reported in 79897 . (Note: The colorbars here are not equivalent and have been adjusted for visibility. Some small data gaps are due to broken Fscan production jobs which may differ by channel.) Fig 3: Same as Fig 2 but zoomed in and with slightly different color bar adjustment. Fig 4: The DELTAL_EXTERNAL zoom from Fig 3 compared with data from H1:PEM-CS_MIC_LVEA_BS_DQ . The tracks appear similar but the noise in H1:PEM-CS_MIC_LVEA_BS_DQ predates its appearance in DARM. It doesn't show up in coherence between the two channels.

There is some evidence that there is extra noise from this compared to end station HEPIs but we will do more tests especially ITMY HEPI to compare better. The first plot shows the injections we did compared to the DARM bands. The noise can show up all the way to high frequency but this might not be too worrisome since we're injecting a lot. The second plot shows the DARM spectra comparison for these tests. The most interesting part is injecting at microseism frequencies. We injected on HEPI at 0.2 Hz observed the ISI signal and then injected on the ISI to match that amplitude. That should tell us if we can distinguish between what's hanging just from HEPI (the ACB) and what's hanging from the ISI (everything else). It seems that the HEPI injection has higher amplitude in DARM at 10-15 Hz and is so far the closest signal we've had to the amplitude we see during microseism fringing. To remind people: Huyen has been on a mission to shake all ISIs and available HEPIs at microseism to check which one could have high enough light amplitude to explain the noise we see. We also did a sweep from 0.2 to 0.5 Hz . It shows some signal in DARM around 0.45 Hz but that might simply be because we're driving the quad resonance so we have do further investigations on this (the ASC signals were large as the sweep went through that freqeuncy). This test is a little confusing because we expect that whatever the source of microseism may be it should couple at all frequencies but the spectrograms are a little less telling that the direct integrated spectra so maybe it's not quite the right way to test. Next steps: - shake ITMY HEPI the same way - do a careful cross comparison with other ISI and HEPI injections - check how much we are injecting versus the seismic signals during microseism noise - try other degrees of freedom not just longitudinal.

See aLogs 68999 69034 70426 71323 71786 73689 for background and discussion. The attached document focuses on a comparison of an 8 hour period on 2 Nov 2024 where no BNS range oscillations are visible and one on 19 Sep 2024 when the oscillations are prominent. For the latter the first 40% or so of the 8 hours shows no visible oscillations followed by strong oscillations for the remainder of that time. The observed properties are introduced using 19 Sep showing the BNS range the “equipment room” temperature and ground motion illustrated in a variety of frequency ranges. When oscillations are visible in the auxiliary channels an overlay of the BNS range is provided. On 19 Sep the EX AHU channels were of three types: (1) channels that displayed the no-oscillation followed by oscillation as shown by the range (2) channels that oscillated through the 8 hour period and (3) channels that were either constant or varied without oscillating. Only channels of type (1) from 19 Sep are shown in the comparison with those of 2 Nov. Unfortunately no patterns have been noticed (at least by me) in the comparison. One might expect the vertical scales to be different from each other on the two days. For most channels that is not the case.

IFO was in MAINTENANCE wind gusts were over 30mph and microseism was very high (troughs higher than 90% line and peaks higher than 100% line for secondary). For the second third of shift I was attempting to lock since winds calmed down but got caught up during initial alignment since SRM WD M3 would trip incessantly during SRC align which I assume is due to the microseism being so high since this doesn't normally happen and it's the primary unique condition. After initial alignment finished IFO reached NLN fully automatically. After an SDF diff clearance (attached) we were observing for a whole 27 minutes! For the third third of shift I was attempting to relock following a Lockloss ( alog 81215 ) caused by a 50mph wind gust that even my less-than-LIGO-sensitive ears could detect. I also confirmed it wasn't the PSL. I waited in DOWN until the gusts got back below 30mph and attempted to relock. The PSL glitch happened a few times in between (since IMC was faulting but winds were low) but we got all the way to FIND_IR until another 38mph gust came though.

I trended the various ETMX ETMY and ITMX suspension channels during these transitions. The first two attachments here show a side by side set of scopes with the left showing a successful transition from Nov 10 and the right showing a failed transition from Nov 9. It appears that in both cases the ITMX L3 drive has a ~1 Hz oscillation that grows in magnitude until the transition. Both the good and bad times show a separate oscillation right at the transition. This occurs right at the end of state 557 so the locklosses within 1 or 2 seconds of state 558 likely are resulting from whatever the of the steps in state 557 do. The second screenshot zooms in to highlight that the successful transition has a different oscillation that rings down whereas the unsuccessful transition fails right where this second ring up occurs. I grabbed a quick trend of the microseism and it looks like the ground motion approximately doubled around Sept 20 (third screenshot). I grabbed a couple of recent successful and unsuccessful transitions since Sept 20 and they all show similar behavior. A successful transition from Sept 19 (fourth attachment) does not show the first 1 Hz ring up just the second fast ring down after the transition. I tried to look back at a time before the DAC change at ETMX but I am having trouble getting any data that isn't minute trend. I will keep trying for earlier times but this already indicates an instability in this transition that our long ramp times are not avoiding. ,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81202,elenna.capote@ligo.org

With Camilla's help I looked through the lockloss tool to see if these are related to the IMC locklosses or not. ""TRANSITION_FROM_ETMX"" and ""LOWNOISE_ESD_ETMX"" are states 557 and 558 respectively. For reference transition from ETMX is the state where DARM control is shifted to IX and EY and the ETMX bias voltage is ramped to our desired value. Then control is handed back over the EX. Then in lownoise ESD some low pass is engaged and the feedback to IX and EY is disengaged. In total since the start of O4b (April 10) there have been 26 locklosses from ""transition from ETMX"" 14 of which have been since the vent recovery on Aug 21 5 of these locklosses are tagged ""IMC"" all occuring on or after October 4. The first lockloss in this state since the vent recovery occured on Sept 13 There is a variety of state duration times in these locklosses ranging from 4 seconds to 2 minutes 57 seconds most of these locklosses before and after the vent have additional tags such as ""windy"" ""earthquake"" etc. Only three appear to have only ""refined"" as a tag From the start of O4b (April 10) to now there have been 22 locklosses from ""lownoise ESD ETMX"" 5 of these occured before the vent none are tagged as IMC All but two of the locklosses occured with state durations between 1-3 seconds in the state before the vent the 5 locklosses have additional tags besides ""refined"" such as ""OMC DCPD"" or ""WINDY"". After the vent most of the locklosses are only tagged as ""refined"". Since the vent one of these locklosses occured on Aug 23 the rest have occurred on or after Sept 27 Trending the microseismic channels the microseism increases seems to correspond with the worsening of this lockloss rate for lownoise ESD ETMX.

Then I disenaged the 10 Hz pole and engaged the digital gain to run the ISS injections (low medium and high frequency). I was fiddling with the IMC WFS pitch injection template to get it to higher frequency for a jitter injection when we lost lock.

We don't use this sensor in loop but it is nice to have L4C witness on HEPI during PEM injections so the plan was swaping this bad sensor out. To access vertical L4C on BSC HEPI one would need to move the HEPI locking plate that is above the actuator and the L4C V-block. Apparently unplug and replug the cable at the sensor fixed the L4C V4 noise issue see ( fig1 - lower right plot with reference trace is when it was bad) I also attemped to fix IPS V1 (low-f noise) but couldn't yet. We narrowed it down to be the electronics chain by switching the pier cables at the input of the AA chassis but we encoutered weird behavior. (1) I unpluged chain from I/O chassis to see ADC noise and they all seemed ok. (2) I then replaced the HEPI AA chassis (twice!) thinking this was the noise source but the noise kept coming back to the same level. (3) Replacing ADC cable also did not help.

The last time the AS port sensors were thoroughly investigated to decouple DHARD/MICH/SRC angular controls was in 2018 [ 37944 and 38148 ] and it is unclear to me if any changes were actually made with maybe some phasing tweaks done since. The 2.7 Hz coupling into DHARD_Y [ which I did preliminary hunting for in aLog 73035 ] which occasionally creates noise in the loop due to degraded phase margin can be seen in all of the ASC controls for those three collections of degrees of freedom (DOFs) DHARD/MICH/SRC Pitch/Yaw. I plot Power Spectra/Coherence/Transfer Functions between these DOFs and DHARD_Y searching for glaring signs of sensing cross coupling [ @56W input power @72W input power ]. There is strong coherence between the DHARD_Y signal and most of the SRC{12}_{P.Y} signals. I believe there is considerable cross coupling in the sensing affecting these loops in the band 1.5-3.5 Hz. The SRC2_{PY} loops only actuate to the M1 stage of the SRM in our present configuration so I suspect these are merely witnesses. The SRC1_{PY} loops drive the SR2 at the M2 stage so any sensed motion is in loop. (Pitch is the biggest offender interestingly). Using DQ data I have traced the onset of this increase in (apparent) coupling between DHARD_Y and SRC2 to the CHARD_Y/DHARD_Y compensation filter change in Feb2024[ 69894 ]. Effects of the filter change [ Screenshot ] is a considerable coherent noise degradation seen in SRC2_Y and SRC1_P. Oddly enough there was little to no change in the filters around 2.7 Hz and I worry something else was changed at the same time that is impacting this coupling. Other than re-doing the AS port sensing matrix nothing comes to mind going forward at the moment. PS There is also considerable cross coupling with noise around 0.4 Hz potentially introducing further unwarned dynamics. ,"{'term': 'L1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73994,vladimir.bossilkov@ligo.org

What happened was that PRMI was poorly aligned (POP18 and 90 I ERR both below 20 counts) but PRMI was able to grab lock for a couple of seconds but would not hold lock as the guardian engaged the top mass offloading adjsuted gains and filters. Eventually this hit the timer in H1 manager to do an initial alignmemt after just over an hour. There is also a timer in ISC that checks if PRMI hasn't locked in 10 minutes it should move onto MICH fringes. This didn't happen in this case because of the very short locks. Ryan and I read through the ISC_LOCK AQUIRE_PRMI state and realized that it had a check (line 1371) for DRMI arrived (in the state PRMI locked) which didn't include a check for the state being done which would return true in ISC LOCK before ISC_DRMI finished the final steps in PRMI locked . In the second zoomed screenshot you can see that as soon as the DRMI guardian enters state 35 (PRMI locked) ISC lock moves on immediately from state 50 (ACQUIRE PRMI) to 51 and 52 (PRMI ASC) which resets the timer so that we never went to MICH fringes. We added a check for the ISC_DRMI state to be both arrived and done in PRMI locked so that PRMI will have to survive the offloading and boost engagement for the timer to be reset. Ibrahim has now reloaded this. We think that if this situation came up again now we would only spend 10 minutes relocking PRMI before going to MICH fringes. If H1 is under the manager control it would run initial alignment if running MICH fringes didn't help. ,"{'term': 'H1 GRD', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81298,sheila.dwyer@ligo.org

Ibrahim looked at the long time between the earthquake and relocking about an hour of that was waiting in ready for the ground motion to come down (which the guardian does independently now) then Ibrahim saw that there were 20 something PRMI locklosses in a row all about 2 seconds after PRMI locked. (We will look into this more) We also looked back at Corey's shift and think that lockloss during the ETM transitions at 2:05 was not a PSL/IMC glitch (noted as LOCK #2 in Corey's alog).

39521,H1 PEM - TCS-Y chiller is likely hurting Crab sensitivity,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81246,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 18:06:20 -0800",Ansel reported that a peak in DARM that interfered with the sensitivity of the Crab pulsar followed a similar time frequency path as a peak in the beam splitter microphone signal. I found that this was also the case on a shorter time scale and took advantage of the long down times last weekend to use a movable microphone to find the source of the peak. Microphone signals don’t usually show coherence with DARM even when they are causing noise probably because the coherence length of the sound is smaller than the spacing between the coupling sites and the microphones hence the importance of precise time-frequency paths. Figure 1 shows DARM and the problematic peak in microphone signals. The second page of Figure 1 shows the portable microphone signal at a location by the staging building and a location near the TCS chillers. I used accelerometers to confirm the microphone identification of the TCS chillers and to distinguish between the two chillers (Figure 2). I was surprised that the acoustic signal was so strong that I could see it at the staging building - when I found the signal outside I assumed it was coming from some external HVAC component and spent quite a bit of time searching outside. I think that this may be because the suspended mezzanine (see photos on second page of Figure 2) acts as a sort of soundboard helping couple the chiller vibrations to the air. Any direct vibrational coupling can be solved by vibrationally isolating the chillers. This may even help with acoustic coupling if the soundboard theory is correct. We might try this first. However the safest solution is to either try to change the load to move the peaks to a different frequency or put the chillers on vibration isolation in the hallway of the cinder-block HVAC housing so that the stiff room blocks the low-frequency sound. Reducing the coupling is another mitigation route. Vibrational coupling has apparently increased so I think we should check jitter coupling at the DCPDs in case recent damage has made them more sensitive to beam spot position. For next generation detectors it might be a good idea to make the mechanical room of cinder blocks or equivalent to reduce acoustic coupling of the low frequency sources.

This required putting a shortcut to the EPICS IOC startup script in the C:\TwinCAT\3.1\Target\StartUp directory (see attached screenshots) and selecting an option in the TwinCAT Visual Studio project to autostart the TwinCAT runtime. We software restarted the computer again to test this and after logging in the Beckhoff runtime and PLC code started along with the EPICS IOC but the visualization did not. I found documentation that pointed to the location of the executable that starts the visualization and added a shortcut to that to the startup directory as well.

The micron displacement in P amounts to 60ct/day of drift which is slightly worse than prev. In general this is about 6x more drift than the previous config but 1/3 the drift of our past more drifty configs. First Look Findings: There is a YAW drift in the current config compared with previous which is somewhat understandable since blade movements at the top stage risk YAW displacement but why is it drifting and not just an offset? There is slightly more F1/P drift in the current config than the previous but I would consider it largely minimal compared to the general amount of drift we've seen in other configurations. ,"{'term': 'X1 SUS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81253,ibrahim.abouelfettouh@ligo.org

Oberling R. Short M. Pirello F. Clara Several PSL items during yesterday's maintenance day: Take TFs of PSL stabilization systems to see where things stand before we start removing things Especially want to check if the apparent EOM resonance peak noted here in the FSS (~1.68MHz) moves with Common gain changes as we would expect Remove in-service TTFSS (SN LHO01) for characterization in the EE shop for preparing working spares and checking for not functional components Test spare TTFSS (SN LHO03) to see if it will lock the RefCav after Marc found several gain issues since the previous test Check ISS AOM RF input connection for tightenss after a suggestion from Tony based on observations seen in PCal AOMs Wire Amp2 power monitor PD to a higher data rate channel (was currently only going to PSL Beckhoff and read into EPICS at 16Hz) Summary Took TFs all looked good FSS Common gain moves the 1.68MHz peak as expected Found ISS AOM RF cable loose re-tightened it with an SMA torque wrench Wired Amp2 power monitor PD to a faster data rate channel H1:PSL-PWR_HPL_DC_OUT_DQ Tested and characterized in-service TTFSS SN LHO01 found and replaced a bad PA85 op amp Tested spare TTFSS SN LHO03 would lock RefCav but would oscillate for a couple minutes before calming down unit has less gain than LHO01 Tuned notches in TTFSS SN LHO01 reinstalled and locked RefCav Details To start we took PMC ISS and FSS transfer functions. The PMC and ISS (1st and 2nd attachments respsectively) look as we had set them at the end of the NPRO swap. The FSS looked as left after lowering the Common gain to 13dB on Nov 1st with the marker on the 1.68MHz peak (3rd attachment) we raised the Common gain to 15dB and saw the peak raise by 2dB as we expect. I didn't get a picture of it but we also lowered the Common gain by 2dB to 11dB and saw the 1.68MHz peak also lower by 2dB also as we expect. Next we wired the Amp2 power monitor PD to an EPICS channel with a faster data rate we used the old High Power Laser (HPL) channel from the HPO days which was still alive and well (and already had a fitting name). We ran a cable to the Lemo tee used to wire the PD to the PSL Sensor Interface Chassis and plugged this cable into the HPL DC port of the PSL Monitoring Fieldbox. We then recalibrated this channel to match the power reading from PSL Beckhoff this required a change in the channel gain from 0.0160515 to 0.047732. The full channel name is H1:PSL-PWR_HPL_DC_OUT_DQ and the data rate is 16kHz. Next we checked the ISS AOM RF connection after a suggestion from Tony (he said they had seen weird AOM glitches in PCal in the past and when this happened they found the RF cable had managed to work itself loose by upwards of half a turn). The ISS was turned OFF the ISS AOM driver was turned OFF the PMC unlocked and the PSL external shutter closed. Using an SMA torque wrench I attempted to tighten the SMA connection to the ISS AOM I found it loose by ~3/4 of a turn. I hadn't considered checking this connection before but after this we will check all of our SMA connections regularly to make sure they are tight (PSL EOM ISS AOM LO and PD inputs on the TTFSS box). At this time I also noted new component locations on the PSL table as a result of the NPRO swap (FI replacement new mode matching solution etc.) so I can update the As-Built PSL table drawing. We also took the opportunity to re-center the Bullseye PD (uses the leakage beam from M10 the first mirror after the ISS AOM) as we had forgot to do this at the end of the NPRO swap. We then removed the in-service TTFSS box SN LHO01 for testing/characterization in the EE shop. Once Fil turned off the high voltage we removed the TTFSS box and took it to the lab where Marc started testing the individual signal paths. Both the Common and PZT paths of the TTFSS looked as expected based on Marc's modeling of the TTFSS circuit but the higher frequency portion of the EOM path looked completely wrong. Marc has all of this data that he can post once he has it in a readable format. The EOM path features 2 op amps in parallel that drive the EOM an AD829 and a PA85. Marc checked the AD829 path and all looked good there so it looked like the PA85 had gone dodgy. I recall in the past when the PA85 blew the FSS either went completely unstable with wall-to-wall oscillations in the PZT path that could not be cured (as noted the last time a PA85 blew in 2019 ) or would not lock the RefCav at all this is completely different behavior than what we have been seeing so we did not suspect the PA85 until Marc took a TF of the TTFSS EOM path. We then began a hunt for a spare PA85 and eventually found 3 of them. We swapped the dodgy PA85 with one of the spares (we now have 2 left) and Marc took the EOM path TF again now all looked as expected based on the models so Marc continued characterizing the in-service TTFSS. While Marc continued characterizing TTFSS SN LHO01 we took the Rev B spare unit SN LHO03 and installed it to see if it could lock the RefCav. Recall that the last time this unit was tested the RefCav would lock but had very large PZT oscillations that never went away Marc subsequently found multiple resistors that were the wrong values (as per the circuit documentation) which would cause gain issues and likely instability in the control loop. Now that Marc had fixed these issues we wanted to test the unit again. With Fil helping with the high voltage we installed unit LHO03 and attempted to lock the RefCav. The cavity immediately locked and immediately begain large oscillations in the PZT. However unlike the last test after about 2 minutes or so the oscillations quit and the RefCav seemed mostly happy (we had to pause the FSS guardian so it would stop yanking the gains around and we set them at -10dB and waited). We did have one moment where the RefCav lost lock for no apparent reason and once it relocked it had the PZT oscillations again. This time they did not clear on their own so we unlocked the and relocked the cavity. The oscillations started again but this time they did clear after about 2 minutes with the gains at -10dB. Now with a seemingly happily locked RefCav we took a TF to set the UGF and measured the crossover. The 5th attachment shows the TF with a UGF of ~439kHz to get this we needed to raise the Common gain from 13dB to 22dB so this box apparently still has lower gain than SN LHO01. The 6th attachment shows the crossover measurement for setting the Fast gain this picture taken with a Fast gain of 10dB. We let it sit and watched for several minutes and the RefCav stayed locked and the loop didn't go into oscillation again. So it seems we have a mostly-working spare unit now with the caveat that the gains still aren't the same and the unit takes some time settle out once the RefCav is locked. The test mostly successful we removed unit LHO03 and went back to the EE shop. At this point Marc had finished characterizing unit LHO01 and indeed he found that the unit had more gain than LHO03. The PZT path was mostly the same with a couple dB more gain in unit LHO01 vs LHO03 but the EOM path at lower frequencies was roughly 20dB different (with unit LHO01 having more gain than LHO03). This fit with our observations from our locking test with unit LHO03. Since we wanted to test if unit LHO01 with the now-fixed PA85 would be better behaved we tuned the notches in the unit. The EOM notch was moved from ~1.77MHz to ~1.68MHz and we moved the PZT notch from ~36kHz (where we found it) to ~32.7kHz (to hopefully squash the new peak we see at ~32.7kHz). This done we took unit LHO01 out to the enclosure and reinstalled it with Fil once again helping out with the high voltage power supply. The RefCav locked almost immediately and had no PZT oscillations upon locking so we took a TF to set the UGF and measured the crossover. The 7th attachment shows the TF with a UGF of ~458kHz and a phase margin of 65.4°. The peak previously seen at ~1.68MHz is now completely gone so the EOM notch tuning was successful. There is still that feature around 750kHz but that has been there and not problematic since April 2015 when notches targeting it were removed. The peakiness previously seen around 500kHz seemed less than observed back on Nov 1st so we left the Common gain at 15dB (we can always lower it by a dB or two should we suspect the gain increase is causing instability with the knowledge this will lower the UGF significantly (2dB causes the UGF to be around 320kHz)). Looking at the crossover (final attachment) we decided to leave it at 5dB as the hump around 20kHz looked better here. It should be noted however that we did not see much change in the hump with small 1dB changes in the Fast gain we didn't start seeing a clear peak at the crossover until the Fast gain got to around 7dB+. It should also be noted that the peak at ~32.7kHz is still present. This indicates either our notch isn't deep enough to remove the peak or the peak is from something other than a PZT resonance. At this point I suspect it's something other than a PZT resonance as we see a 2nd and 3rd harmonic of this peak in the IN1 spectrum (2nd harmonic at ~65.5kHz 3rd at ~98kHz) I realized after we had left the LVEA that I didn't get a picture of the IN1 spectrum at the full span of the SR785 that shows these harmonics. This done we cleaned up and left the enclosure. Back in the Control Room we relocked the ISS and Tony relocked the IMC. There was some IMC instability seen but we chalked it up to ground motion from a recent earthquake. Marc mentioned that moving the PZT notch lowered the overall gain in the PZT path slightly so we raised the Fast gain to 6dB since we had seen a 1dB gain change not have a large effect on the crossover. Eventually once the environment had calmed down (Corey was on the Eve shift at this point) the relocking process began. The IMC lost lock during expected points in the initial alignment process so we weren't too worried about it. However there was one IMC lockloss during the relock (I think during Find IR?) and it took the IMC many minutes to relock. There were no PSL oscillations or glitches going on while we were waiting for the IMC to relock so not sure what the issue was it completely refused to grab lock and when it would look like it was going to grab it the IMC Trans image swung away quickly. Elenna did question why MC2 was apparently swinging around so much (the IMC Trans camera image was moving all over the place hinting at MC2 being pushed hard) so this behavior was not exactly normal. Eventually the IMC relocked and the locking process continued. At this point we called it a day hoping that things would be more stable overnight. Turns out they were not so we're still not sure where the problem is. Investigations will continue.

I'm writing an alog covering the entirety of our work yesterday right now but we raised the gains due to finding a bad component in the in-service TTFSS (the PA-85 high voltage op-amp in the EOM path) whose replacement removed reduced the observed zero crossings around 500kHz noted by Sheila et al here and corrected anomolies Marc observed in the EOM path TF (he has the data for this). We also correctly tuned the EOM notch to remove the 1.685MHz peak also seen in the linked alog. Raising the common gain put the FSS UGF back in its normal range (400kHz - 500kHz) and we raised the Fast gain by 1dB to compensate for a slight loss of gain in the PZT path caused by our moving the PZT notch from ~35.7kHz to ~32.7kHz. The TF and crossover measurement showed all should be well with the FSS after these fixes so it's still unclear why these IMC locklosses continue. Edit: Upon closer inspection of the TF the peakiness around 500kHz is still present but apparently less yet still close to a zero crossing. We could lower the Common gain by 1dB (to 14dB) to better clear the zero crossing if we suspect this is causing instability.,"{'term': 'LHO General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81244,jason.oberling@ligo.org

This new line does not show up in DARM but is sometimes large enough that it is getting impressed onto L1:GDS-CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN by the online NonSENS subtraction.As this is a narrow line at this time we've simply notched it out in the L1:OAF-IMC_WFS_B_I_PIT_PREFILT filter module using FM1 (called notch130).

From the guardian log (attached) it failed because AS_B_DC_NSUM was 20.3 when the shutter was closed and the threshold is 15. AS_B was 0.28. Fundamentally this is because I reduced the gain of this DC path by 20dB and digitally compensated in search for an existing sensor that won't rail when lock is lost and the same fast shutter test failure was observed (see alog 79104 ). Back then I wrote ""I adjusted the dark offset while IMC was unlocked but we can probably increase the threshold to 30 or so if it continues to bother us."" The dark offset has drifted enough to bother us at times (i.e. it is about 12 counts or so on average now) so I told Ibrahim to increase the thresholds only for AS_B i.e. PdBDarkLo=-40 # dark level low PdBDarkHi= 40 # dark level high in FAST_SHUTTER.py. Since we now have a dedicated diode to look at lock loss power spikes we can turn down the analog gain of AS_B_DC by 20dB and turn off +20dB filter in FM4 of H1:ASC-AS_B_DC_SEG[1234] filter and adjust the dark offset again on Tuesday.

Today this was mostly due to 3 reasons. 1. Environment: Wind gusts are currently 40 mph mostly above 30 mph for the whole day. There were a few gusts above 50 mph with a couple above 60mph (with one at 62 mph the highest I've seen). Secondary microseism is back over the 90% threshold for microseism. This is the main reason we were unable to lock during the shift. 2. IMC: The IMC glitch has dominated our locking attempts during lulls in the wind speed. It occured during initial alignment as well as during normal locking multiple times. This occured a few times after we had already locked DRMI under such windy conditions and so getting back to DRMI was either glitchy or windy and only happened twice today. The glitch has happened during all non-windy lock acquisitions. 3. Fast Shutter Error : At 20:01 we were at CHECK_AS_SHUTTERS during a lull in wind speed when we lost lock. After this locklossm the HAM6 SHUTTER status alert went red and guardian warned me not to power up. After calling a couple of people Keita was able to diagnose the issue as a code threshold error. I went into the fast shutter guardian and changed the threshold of PdBDarkLo from -15 to -40 and PdBDarkHi from 15 to 40. More background and info is available in Keita's comment to my midshift alog 81320 . This took 1hr 43 mins to diagnose and solve. A calibration sweep has not been done yet (since Saturday).

First we had planned comissioning from 8:30AM to 11:30AM during which comissioners continued investigating the IMC. Sheila went into the LVEA to realign onto the POP and ALS beatnotes following a PR3 move that got higher buildups which was successful. For this we stayed at CHECK_VIOLINS_BEFROE_POWERUP (losing lock twice from there due to IMC losing lock). We then got to locking and were able to acquire NLN and go into OBSERVING for 30 minutes (starting 21:44 UTC). The IMC glitch then caused a Lockloss (alog 81338) . After this LL we were unable to lock DRMI despite just having done an initial alignment. Tried touching up PRM and SRM during PRMI and DRMI respectively succeeding in the former and failing in the latter. I decided to do an initial alignment which happened fully automatically. We were able to lock DRMI but a lockloss at CARM_5_PICOMETERS brought us down due to the IMC glitch. We were then able to come back up to NLN fully automatically finally getting to OBSERVING. Overall high microseism and IMC glitches made locking difficult. We still got there in the end though.

This indeed got somewhat okay flashes on both ALSs so will be a fine place to start from once the reference cavity is locked again. However I found that TMSY's pitch slider has a minus sign with respect to the OSEM readbacks for pitch. This is the only slider (out of pit or yaw for all 6 optics that affect ALS alignment for either arm) that seems to have this issue. In the attached screenshot when I try to move the TMS up the OSEM readbacks say it went down and vice versa.

LLO has been using this for O4 and in terms of an automation step this would be comparable to our Increase_Flashes state. Increase_Flashes is very simple in how it works - move one direction one degree of freedom at a time look for better cavity flashes move the other way if they get worse. While this is reliable it is very slow since we have to wait for one period of the quad between each step (20seconds) to ensure we dont miss a flash. The last two days I spent some time converting Adam's state Scan_Alignment for use at LHO adjusting thresholds and other parameters and trying to improve on parts of it so it might work a bit more reliably. The most notable change I've made is to get data from the fast channel for the arm transmission rather than collecting slow channel data. This seemed to help a bit but this completely relies on nds calls that we've historically found not 100% reliable. I've also lowered minimum thresholds thanks to the previous change. This allows it to start off from basically no light in the cavity and bring it up to a decent alignment. After these changes it seems to really improve the flashes from a very misaligned starting point but I'm not sure it's any faster than the Increase_Flashes state. In the attached example it took around 20-30 min to go from little to no light to a decent amount. I'm testing this without the PLL and PDH locked so it's hard to say exactly how well aligned it is and how much better it can get. Next I'd like to take some time on a Tuesday to test with a PDH&PLL locked ALS and compare it to the time it takes compared to Increase_Flashes for a very misaligned cavity and a barely misaligned cavity. I've committed the changes I've made to ALS_ARM.py ALS_YARM.py (both in common) to the SVN. This created a new state - SCAN_ALIGNMENT - that I'll keep there but isn't in the state graph so it cannot be reached.

I'm looking at times when the interferometer is in the low noise state (for H1 ISC_LOCK >=600 for L1 ISC_LOCK >=2000). The first piechart shows what guardian states we spend the most time in this is pretty similar to what Mattia reported in 79623 The histograms of lock segement lengths and relocking times show that L1's lock stretches are longer than H1s and that we've had 34 individual instances where we were down for longer than 12 hours. (And that H1 has a lot of short locks) The rolling and cumulative avergage plot shows how the drop in duty cycle in O4b compare to O4a is due to individual problems including the OFI break pressure spikes and laser issues. Lastly the final plot shows how we accumulate uptime and down time bined by length of the segments. This shows that L1 accumulates more uptime than Hanford by having more locks in the 30-50 hour range. The downtime accumulation shows that just under half of our downtime is from times when we were down for more than 16 hours (serious problems) and about 1/4 of it is due to routine relocking that takes less than 2.5 hours. The script and data used to make these plots can be found in DutyCycleO4a.py and H1(L1)ISCLockState_04.txt in this git repo .

Oberling R. Short Since we've convinced ourselves that the new glitching is coming from the recently-installed NPRO SN 1661 we are swapping it out for our final spare SN 1639F. This is the NPRO originally installed with the aLIGO PSL back in the 2011/2012 timeframe it was removed from operation in late 2017 (natural degradation of pump diodes) and sent back to Coherent for refurbishment and has not been used outside of brief periods in the OSB Optics Lab since. We first installed the power supply for this NPRO and tweaked the potentiometers on the remote board to make sure our readbacks in the PSL Beckhoff software were correct. We then swapped the NPRO laser head on the PSL table and got the new one in position. The injection current was set for ~1.8W of output power we need 1.945A for ~1.805 W output from the NPRO. We test the remote ON/OFF which worked and the remote noise eater ON/OFF which also worked. We optimized the polarization cleanup optics (a QWP/HWP/PBSC triple combo for turning the NPRO's naturally slightly elliptically polarized beam into vertically polarized w.r.t. the PSL tabletop). The power was turned down and the beam was roughly aligned using our alignment irises (with the mode matching lenses removed). At this point we did a beam propagation measurement and Gaussian fit in prep for mode matching to Amp1. The results: Horizontal Waist: 176.0 µm Position: -124.3 mm Vertical Waist: 182.0 µm Position: -169.3 mm Average Waist: 178.8 µm Position: -147.2 mm Using this we got a preliminary mode matching solution in JamMT using the same lenses we used for NPRO SN 1661 so we installed it. I managed to get a picture before JamMT crashed on us see first attachment. Before tweaking mode matching we checked our polarization into Faraday isolator FI01. We have ~1.602 W in transmission of FI01 with ~1.701 W input a throughput of ~94.2%. We then proceeded with optimizing the mode matching solution. It took several iterations (7 to be exact) but we finally were able to get the beam waist and position correct for Amp1 (the target is a 165 µm waist 60mm in front of Amp1 or 1794.2mm from the NPRO): Horizontal: Waist: 166.0 µm Position: 1789.0 mm Vertical Waist: 163.0 µm Position: 1800.0 mm Average Waist: 164.6 µm Positoin: 1794.5 mm To finish we set up a temporary PBSC to check that the polarization going into Amp1 was vertical w.r.t. the PSL tabletop. We put a power meter in transmission of the temporary PBSC and adjust WP02 to minimize the transmitted power the lowest we could get is 0.41 mW (with a roughly 1.6 W beam) in the wrong polarization which matches what we had during the most recent NPRO swap so we were good to go here. We forgot to measure the final lens positions before leaving the enclosure we will do that first thing tomorrow morning. The new NPRO is now set aligned and mode matched to Amp1 and we will continue with amplifier recovery tomorrow. We left the NPRO running overnight with enclosure in Science mode the first shutter (between the NPRO and Amp1) is closed. ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81409,jason.oberling@ligo.org

It is saved in sheila.dwyer/PSL/modematching along with a copy of the a la mode code (alm). I took the beam profile measurements that they saved in /ligo/gitcommon/labutils/beam_scans/Data/NPRO_a_21Nov2024.txt and used them for fitting. In this text file the distances are a rail location I used the information in 80895 and compared it to what I got by fitting the data in NPRO_26Oct2024.txt to find the offset between their rail distances and their coordinate system. From their data I get a horizontal waist at 162.1um at -0.097 meters and a vertical waist of 182.1 um at -0.176 meters (see first attachment). This is more astigmatism than the laser 1661 had. If no mode matching had been done at all with this NPRO swap we would end up with an overlap of 87% to amp1 (sqrt(X overlap* y overlap)). I used the average of the vertical and horizontal waist locations and asked a la mode to optimize lens 2 + 3 for that average waist (as Jason and Ryan were only planning to move lens 2 + 3 to avoid changing the waist through the EOM).

Then I just made some simple time series comparison plots between several PSL channels and PSL PEM channels. In particular the PSL channels I used were: H1:PSL-FSS_FAST_MON_OUT_DQ H1:PSL-FSS_TPD_DC_OUT_DQ H1:IMC-MC2_TRANS_SUM_IN1_DQ H1:PSL-PWR_NPRO_OUT_DQ H1:PSL-PMC_MIXER_OUT_DQ H1:PSL-PMC_HV_MON_OUT_DQ.

For this analysis I've only looked at 3 time periods but will do more. Below are some things I've seen so far: I definitely do see correlations between the IMC/FSS (IMC_MC2_TRANS & FSS_FAST_MON) channels and the PEM PSL sensors. In particular it seems like the most consistent correlations are with the PSL_PERISCOPE_X/Y and PSL_TABLE1_X/Y/Z channels. In some cases there was a visible glitch in PSL_TABLE2_Z but the amplitude is much less than in the other PEM channels. Some PEM glitches correlate with the glitching in PMC_HV_MON but this was only the case for 2 of the 3 times I looked at. Some PEM glitches correlate with PMC_MIXER but I wonder if that is just a coincidence (see slide 9 for an example) I have seen no obvious correlation with the PEM PSL sensor glitches and the NPRO_PWR channel. From my very limited dataset so far it seems like the most interesting area is where the PSL_PERISCOPE_X/Y and PSL_TABLE1_X/Y/Z channels are located.

So far for LLO our understanding is that the microseismic ground motion (0.1-0.5 Hz) is being amplified by a potential scatterer which has a transfer function as shown in the first image . This transfer function was modeled based on some other information and seems to explain the LLO noise quiet well ( LLO aLOG 73845 ). For LHO we amplified the ground motion by the same transfer function and simulated the scatter shelf. If we assume that the scattered light amplitude is same as LLO (4e-10) given the amount of microseismic ground motion at LHO the scatter shelf falls below the current DARM spectra of LHO ( second image ). Even if we double the light amplitude the scatter shelf does not show up above the present noise background ( third image ) but it comes quiet close to the noise floor. But if we double the microseismic ground motion and then further amplify it by the model transfer function the scatter shelf shows up above the present DARM spectra ( fourth image ). This shows that the same source which is producing the microseismic scattering at LLO can produce similar noise at LHO but it will only be visible if the IFO is locked during a somewhat high microseismic motion. Even if the amount of light is half of what it is at LLO the scatter shelf would still be visible if the ground motion is higher ( fifth image ). I used the ground motion as it was during 2023-12-06 11:00:00 UTC at LHO. This is one of the high microseismic days of LHO the median of rms ground motion in 0.1-0.3 Hz was 689.66 nm/s and in 0.3-1.0 Hz was 95.02 nm/s. In the last image I plot all the simulated traces together for a better visualization of how the light amplitude and amount of motion can modify the scatter shelf.

What can cause PMC mixer glitches? NPRO Laser frequency glitches .... seems likely PMC cavity length glitches (e.g. servo electronics or PZT) .... most likely no 81390 . Likely PDH is optically sensing real glitches as we have already switched the 35.5 MHz LO to the Marconi 81277 that made no difference ...... rule out the 35.5 MHz LO. Unlikely PMC because the PMC mixer glitches on the scope seem too fast for the PMC locking electronics. Daniel found that the ""PMC servo drives the PZT with a 3.3K series resistor forming a ~1kHz low pass with the PZT capacitance of ~45nF. This yields a chracteristic time constant of ~150us. The glitches as seen by the PMC mixer are at least a few times faster than this."" 81390 Daniel's scope photo here shows ""a train of PMC mixer glitches going as high as ~70mVpk (or ~70kHz)"" similar to the zoomed-in glitches Peter showed above. So this means that glitches originating in the PMC locking servo or PZT electronics would change the PMC cavity length too slowly to create the fast PMC mixer glitches we observe. Seems unlikely that PMC servo locking electronics are the issue. Unlikely mechanical / PZT issues given the very nice PMC cavity scans - optically the cavity scans don't show glitches or issues as a function of the PZT drive ( remote scope traces + sheila pmc pzt scan photo ). Biggest change to the glitches came from swapping the original O4 laser to now the O3 laser. Glitches changed when lasers changed: see Camilla lho:81386 . Seems like a clue that the glitches are related to the specific lasers themselves. Talking with Jason and RyanS some summary of the NPROs available: (S/N 1661) The O3 NPRO was swapped in recently. Potentially we now see the same problems with 1661 was seen in the end of O3b. Camilla's 81386 shows that the FSS oscillations with this laser in O4 look a lot like its issues at the end of O3b. In 2020 these FSS issues originally prompted Camilla to create the FSS_OSCILLATION tags. These FSS_OSCILLATION tags started to be flagged regularly again in mid-Sept 2024 but with the original O4 laser the FSS oscillations looked totally different: see her log 81386. (S/N 7974) The original O4 NPRO was in use Sept 2017 - June 2018 when it was uninstalled ( 42652 ) seemingly due to similar fast FSS glitches leading to a broken noise eater. Jason looked at alogs from time of removing this NPRO in 2018 and the 2018 glitches look like the original Sept 2024 glitches. 7974 was then sent back to Coherent for repair + refurbished. This is the newest NPRO bought in 2015 and the only one that Coherent will service. Then 7974 was installed for O4. (S/N 1639F) The ""third"" NPRO is from O1 and was in use for many years 2011-2017. It was wearing out its lifetime and running out of power then removed and refurbished. Since was only used a few times in the optics lab. Will try this 3rd NRPO.

There is large individual glitches seen by both FSS and the NPRO PWR in an otherwise quiet signal before the NPRO swap. Plotted after the NPRO swap here and zoomed here. There is none of these individual glitches after the swap but there is the slower building oscillation in the FSS channel which is overall noisier. The FSS oscillations we are seeing now are similar to the FSS_OSCLATION locklosses we saw at the end of O3b ( G2201762: O3a_O3b_summary.pdf ). Note that the current NPRO is the same NPRO as we used in O3. Is it possible that we fixed the glitches issues but reinstalled a laser with similar issues as we saw in O3b? We could revisit that time period to see if we had similar IMC locking issues then too.

Peter's alog comment last night ( 81375 ) leads us to understand the glitches are around 2 kHz in frequency so above the PMC bandwidth. Therefore we want to calibrate the PMC error signal. Luckily for us Jeff Kissel recently did some PMC scans to determine the PMC PZT Hz/V calibration for a different purpose alog 73905 (thanks Jeff!). We used his DTTs to determine the time it took to scan one FSR see screenshot . We determined that it took 0.52 seconds to scan one FSR and the scan rate is approximately 6.75 V/s (we know the PZT is nonlinear but we figure this estimate is good enough for our purposes). This gives us 3.51 V/FSR on the PZT or 0.0236 V/MHz using the FSR = 148.532 MHz from T0900616 . We are still thinking about how to calibrate the PMC mixer signal.

(presumably good) laser + PMC bad = same PMC mixer glitches 81371 1) Are these +/-0.1 V PMC mixer glitches the problem? Yes probably. 2) Are these big PMC mixer glitches caused or worsened by the FSS? No. PMC mixer glitches basically same with FSS on 81356 and off 81371 . 3) Are the laser + PMC mixer glitches new? Yes probably. If these PMC glitches always there could it be that we were previously able to ride them out before and not now? But this would imply that in addition to the new glitches the FSS secondarily degraded. Seems very unlikely: already several problems (bad amp new eom needed new notch etc) have been fixed with FSS and the FSS OLTFs and in-loop spectra look good.

The period of large glitches started around 2 am (7:37 UTC on Nov 20th) and ended when a power glitch turned off the laser at 7 am (15 UTC) 81376 . Some of the small glitches in that time frame time seem to be at the same time that the reference cavity was resonanting (with low transmission) but many of the large glitches do not line up with times when the reference cavity was resonanting. I've zoomed in on most of the times when the PMC mixer glitches reached 0.1 and see that there are usually small jumps in NPRO power at the time of these glitches although the times don't always line up well and the small power glitches are happening very often so this might be a coincidence. ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81379,sheila.dwyer@ligo.org

We started from the PEM rack in the CER plugging the HS1 through the SR560 into the L4C interface chassis confirming the HS1 would see something when we tapped it. We then moved out to the PEM bulkhead by HAM4 again confirmed the HS1/SR560 combo still showed signal when tapping the HS1. Then we moved to the biergaren and plugged in the HS1/SR560 right next to the other seismometers. While watching the readout in the DAQ of the HS1 and one of the Guralps I have connected to the PEM AA we could see that both sensors could see when I slapped the ground near the seismometers but the signal was barely above what looks like electronics noise on the HS1 while the Guralp showed lots of signal that looked like ground motion. We tried gains from 50-200 on the SR560 none of them really seemed to improve the snr of the HS1. The HS1 is still plugged in over night but I don't think this particular sensor is going to measure much ground motion.

TJ Recently the CO2Y laser that we replaced on Oct 22 has been struggling to stay locked for long periods of time ( alog81271 and trend from today ). We've found some loose or bad cables in the past that have caused us issues so we went out on table today to double check they are all ok. The RF cables that lead into the side of the laser can slightly impact the output power when wiggled in particular the ones with a BNC connector but not to the point that we think it would be causing issues. The only cable that we found loose was for the PZT that goes to the head of the laser. The male portion of the SMA that comes out of the laser head was loose and cannot be tightened from outside of the laser. We verified that the connection from this to the cable were good but wiggling it did still introduce glitched in the PZT channel. I don't think that we've conviced ourselves that this is a problem though because the PZT doesn't seem to glitch when the laser loses lock and instead it will run away. An unfortunate consequence of the cable wiggling was that one of the Beckhoff plugs at the feedthrough must have been unseated slightly and caused our mask flipper read backs to read incorrectly. The screws for this plug were not working so we just pushed the plug back in to fully seat it and all seemed to work again. We still are not sure why we've been having these lock losses lately the 2nd and 3rd attachments show a few of them from the last day or so. They remind me of back in 2019 when we saw this - example1 example2 . The fix ultimately a chiller swap ( alog54980 ) but the flow and water temp seem more stable this time around.

In the attached screenshot you can see that there are a few large disturbances during this time which show up with an amplitude of 0.1 on the PMC mixer channel and large oscillations in the FSS fast monitor (30 counts) dips in the reference cavity transmission and glitches in the PMC high voltage. The second screenshot shows a zoomed in version of the problem times. We also noticed that unplugging the feedback from the IMC to the VCO changed the reference cavity transmitted power by about 1% Daniel suggests that this might be OK because the change in laser frequency causes a small change in alignment out of the AOM. We set the FSS autolocker to off at 19:54 UTC. This doesn't acutaly disable the FSS but we can track times when the reference cavity would go through resonance by watching in the trans PD.

Since this is not necessary any more (see plots in alog 81130 ) and since keeping this means that we have to either adjust dark offset once in a while and/or making the ""shutter closed"" threshold for Fast Shutter test ( alog 81320 ) I set the gain switch back to ""HIGH"" and disabled the +20dB digital gain in H1:ASC-AS_B_DC_SEG[1234] FM4.

We have found a BBSS configuration that doesn't drift after some extended settling time. However the BBSS configuration that doesn't drift has extreme blade positions so we hope to change d0 and d1 parameters to get a more ""healthy"" BBSS. We have been fighting a pitch drift in the BBSS for some time. Here is what we know: The pitch drift is not a thermal effect and is seen always in one direction. The daily drift due to temperature can sometimes be seen on top of the pitch drift but the drift dominates. The drift is usually pretty linear over long periods of time. The drift is primarily in the top mass. M2 and M3 stages see far less of the drift but do move slowly as the top mass moves. Since the drift is dominated by M1 we have tried a lot of different configurations. Initially we thought the blades that hold the wire leading from M1 to M2 was to high (this is related to the d1 parameter of a suspension). So we lowered the blades and tried a couple different configurations. Then it was discovered that the issue was not from the blades on M1 but rather the point where M1 is supported. The ""pickup"" point of M1 was below the center of mass while nominally it should be above (this is the d0 parameter of a suspension). To remedy this we lowered the center of mass on M1 and lowered the blades on M1 to ensure that the pickup point of m1 is above the center of mass and the blade tips leading to M2 are below the center of mass. Initially we were worried that the suspension was still drifting but after a few days and relieving some rubbing the pitch drift was gone. Currently we lowered the center of mass further to see if our theory on why the pitch drift stopped is correct but the suspension hasn't had enough time to settle yet. The blades are currently quite low (-6 mm below there nominal values). At some point we hope to raise them to a more reasonable height off nominal. To help raise the blades and buy both us an Hanford some margin of stability Betsy is getting some parts fabricated to raise the d0 value of the suspension. Attached is a long drift log with a short description of the many configurations and plots of their pitch. F1 + F2 + F3 are the three bosems that contribute to pitch.

Additionally I noticed the DC power suppy for the RGA is resting against the stand. I went ahead and put a few viton pads under the RGA's DC power suppy in case it was making noise as current goes up (e.g. filament on vs off in alog 74095 ). RGA is plugged in and ON now at the X-Mid. 4:19 PM - Turned RGA fillaments ON for X-Mid Y-Mid LVEA-X Beamtube LVEA-Y Beamtube. Will submit a new work permit to take scans at 4 weeks after resuming interferometer operation next maintence Tuesday. I plan on taking the last set of scans Tuesday morning then unplugging every RGA on site before maintenance period is over so everything is off over Thanksgiving. If the noise at the X-Mid station from the RGA should be shifted now from alog 74088 since we changed the mechanical dampening characteristics of the support stand. Closing WP 11940 .

As a result the measurements may vary and could be off by a few millimeters. This time with the assistance of two colleagues from Spain I was able to improve the accuracy of the measurements. We measured from the outer edge of the top of the ALS table instead of from the inside. Additionally we confirmed that the viewport diameter is approximately 10 inches as indicated in D1200873 . Furthermore we check the position of the green beam on the viewport. The beam is located as follows: Vertical position Horizontal Location of ALS beam on the viewport (BSC5 - VP C90G3) ~ 5 3/4"" from the outer top edge of the Viewport guard ~4 1/4"" from the left outer edge of the Viewport guard 14.6 cm 10.795 cm See the pictures attached for reference.

Looking at the BLRMs we decided that 5.6/-1.1 was better than 5.6/-0.85 so left it there . Sdfs accepted attached. We had to pause SQZ_MANAGER as it was not letting us bring SQZ_ANG_ADJUST to DOWN. Also worked by taking SQZ_MANAGER to SCAN_SQZ_ANG. Future improvements: Repeat now we have the ASC on. Can we do this in anti-squeezing to be faster (hard to use ASC). Do we need to have the servo turn off SQZ_ANG_ADJUST and scan SQZ ang at each step or can we just leave the servo running? We also turned the FC beam-spot control on to test it again while we are thermalizing (worked fine) and turned it off before finishing commissioning: reverted sdfs so H1:SQZ-FC_ASC_INJ_ANG_{PY}_OUTPUT are frozen a edited sqzparams and reloaded.

The autolocker fails to lock so the TPD drops back to zero and the temperature search continues. The pattern seen in the PMC_HV signal is the PMC following the NPRO frequency change as the FSS autolocker slowly ramps the NPRO crystal temperature to try to lock the RefCav (this is why the NPRO temperature channel has the same shape as PMC_HV). Not clear why the RefCav doesn't want to lock as quickly with this NPRO as it did with the previous ones but we did see this behavior upon FSS recovery last Friday (I had to lock the RefCav manually so we could move on with PSL recovery as the autolocker was taking too long). I recall seeing this behavior in the past (pre-COVID) and at the time we couldn't figure out the cause. Will look into this more after the Thanksgiving holiday.

I also wanted to compare it to our current Increase_Flashes state both in duration and execution. The big changed from last week's testing is that now that we have a working PSL the PLL and PDH loops are locked. This seemed to really help out and it seems like a very viable solution for a faster alignment state.

I haven't put the functionality back into Scan_Alignment to hold and alignment if it get above threshold so once I can test that out again it will speed up the smaller misalignment scans. Saving a few minutes for every acquisition that needs some alignment work should add up pretty quick. If given more time next week I'd like to test this some more with that functionality and see how much faster it is. I'd love to get this into production soon but I really want to thoroughly test this. Last week Jenne had to comment out an import of aslArmconfig out of ALS_ARM.py in order for ALS_XARM to run ( alog81424 ). This was a bit odd to me since this file contained info for both arms and should be fine. I ended up restarting ALS_XARM and this worked. Seems like another case of issue 22 .

The following solution while not perfect is just good enough to get us to next Tuesday maintenance. 1 - Failed supply fan on CER-C5 LHS ISC-R2&R4 +24V is runnning at 90F front and rear no airflow. The ambient air in that location is very cool and the current draw is quite low so we do not expect this supply to trip in these conditions. Fernando noticed that the -24V supply on the same rack is also slightly elevated in temperature and does not have good air flow so we suspect this supply fan is comprimised as well. Neither of these supplies have had their fans upgraded yet. 2 - Failed supply fan on EX-VDD-1 ISC-R1 +24V 3A was running at 110F front and rear no airflow. This supply has not had its fan upgraded yet. The PCAL team was using this supply so we could not replace it before close of maintenance window. We applied supplementary cooling to the power supply to see it through until next Tuesday. After supplemental cooling we measured 85F front and 95F rear. The power supply tray had to be pulled out about 1 foot into the walkway to make space for the supplemental cooling I placed cones around the hazard be mindful of the extended rack tray if you do go out to EX berfore next Tuesday.

We suspect this to be due to slightly worse mode-matching into the PMC which we plan to check in the coming weeks. ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81485,ryan.short@ligo.org

TJ and I are investigating. So far we know that SRM sees elevated noise while in PREP_FOR_SRY particularly after SRM re-alignment. We've also found that AS_C SUM is too low to be considered locked at this state but that ALIGN_IFO guardian continues with SR initial alignment leading to the WD trip. The current hypothesis is that SRM is catching onto a wrong mode but tricking the automation into continuing alignment. The first screenshot shows the incidence of the WD tripping during initial alignment happening frequently after 10/30. There is one instance of it happening 10/16 but nothing in the near past before that. The second shows one recent instance of this trip leading to the WD trip.

The IFO range has been mostly below 160Mpc with short times near 165Mpc in the first hour of each lock. The first attachment shows a comparison of the cleaned GDS strain sensitivity at the 165 Mpc time to later in the lock along with coherences from the lower range time. The sensitivity earlier in the lock was broadly better from 18-55 Hz there are coherences with both ASC and LSC that are contributing to the noise from 18-27 Hz so we spent some time trying to address those. The worse sensitivty from 27-55 Hz is not explained by these coherences and the usual squeezing adjustments ( 81463 81458 ) don't seem to be able to help. We might think about checking both the SRC detuning and the filter cavity detuning to see if they make an impact in this region. We do seem to have slightly less high frequency squeezing than in the past. To address the ASC coherences I ran the A2L script that TJ put in userapps/isc/h1/scripts/a2l/a2l_min_multi.py with the command python a2l_min_multi.py --all The second attachment shows this script running using an ndscope template that is in sheila.dwyer/ndscope/ASC/A2L_script_ADS.yaml The first time through the pitch a2l gains for ETMY ITMY and ITMX were all set to the maximum that the script checks so we ran it again. The third attachment shows the coherences (with no squeezing) after this A2L adjustment and Camilla's adjustment of the PRCL feedforward . In the past we've seen that after running this a2l script we can do slightly better by dong a manual adjustment based on injections into CHARD or DHARD ( 79921 80250 ) we haven't taken the time to check that today but the script does seem to have helped in the frequency region where it's measuring. It has made the CHARD Y coherence worse below 15 Hz which we've seen consistently when the decoupling is good around 20-30 Hz. The last attachment shows a comparison of the DARM sensitivty in the high range early part of the lock the lower later sensitivity and currently after these retunings but without squeezing. This suggests that our adjustments did a good job below 27 Hz where we the squeezing does have an impact in this frequency band where we haven't yet recovered the sensitivity.

The new positions: L02: 1251.5 mm L21: 1137.5 mm Amplifier Recovery With the previous day's work resulting in the NPRO being ready for amplifier recovery this is where we started our recovery work. Amplifier recovery was straightfoward. As a reminder we first measure the power into the amp and the unpumped power out to assess our intial alignment. Then we raise the amp pump diode operating current in 1A intervals until we get to the locking point adjusting beam alignment into the amplifier at each step in current (so alignment follows the formation of the thermal lenses in the amplifier crystals). For Amp1 we had 1.612 W input and an unpumped output of 1.252 W. This is 77.6% throughput which is above our requirement of 65% throughput before starting to pump the amplifier so we proceeded with recovery of Amp1 (see Amp1 columns in below table). We finished Amp1 recovery with ~70.2 W output so we calibrated the Amp1 power monitor PD to this value (was off by a couple Watts). We then lowered the light level in the Amp1/Amp2 path (using the High Power Attenuator (HPA) after Amp1) and checked alignment all looked good. We increased the Amp2 seed with the HPA to ~1.8 W and checked the unpumped output from Amp2. This measured at ~1.5 W which is ~83% throughput and above our 65% threshold so we proceeded with recovery of Amp2. This also went very well see the Amp2 column in the below table we had ~64.0 W output from Amp2 with an ~1.8 W initial seed power (the power was bouncing between 63.9 W and 64.0 W). With Amp2 fully powered we then used the HPA to increase the Amp2 seed to max which resulted in ~ 140.2 W output from Amp2. Current (A) Amp1 Output Power (W) Amp2 Output Power (W) Initial P out Final P out Initial P out Final P out 1 1.25 1.25 1.6 1.6 2 1.46 2.37 3.0 3.0 3 6.11 8.43 9.1 9.3 4 16.6 18.1 18.2 18.4 5 28.6 28.6 28.1 28.4 6 39.6 39.6 38.0 38.2 7 50.3 50.4 47.4 47.5 8 60.7 60.7 55.8 56.8 9 70.2 70.2 63.7 64.0 Stabilization System Recovery PMC: After lunch we began recovering the PSL stabilization systems in order: PMC ISS FSS. We began by using the HPA after Amp2 to lower the power to ~100 mW to check our beam alignment up to the PMC. All looked good here so we increased the power to max and measured the power incident on the PMC at ~129.4 W. We then toggled the PMC autolock to ON and it locked without issue. We needed to use the picomotor-equipped mirrors (M11 and M12 on the layout) to tweak the beam alignment into the PMC but were only able to get ~102.0 W in transmission with ~27.0 W in reflection. This is 9 W more than we had after our last NPRO swap indicating that we really need to take a look at PMC mode matching since we still had more than enough power to deliver to the IFO we decided to defer the mode matching work to a later Tuesday and continue with PSL recovery. The PMC Trans and Refl monitor PDs were calibrated to the newly measured values they were pretty close to begin with but were still 1-2 W different than our power meter was measuring. We then returned the amplifer pump diode currents to their previous operating values (9.0 A and 8.8 A for Amp1 9.1 A and 9.1 A for Amp2) which lowered Amp1 output power from ~70 W to ~68 W and Amp2 output power from ~140 W to ~139 W this also changed PMC Refl to ~24 W and PMC Trans to ~104 W indicating our beam is better matched to our current mode matching solution at these pump diode currents. ISS: Moving on to the ISS we first measured the amount of power in our 1st order diffracted beam (the ""power bank"" for the ISS). With the loop off and the AOM diffracting a default of 4% we expect ~5.7 W in this beam and this is what we measured. AOM alignment was good so moved on to the ISS PDs in the ISS box. A voltmeter get plugged into the DC Out ports on the ISS box and a HWP inside the box is adjusted until PD voltages read ~10.0 V. We did this but noticed the DC voltage reading on the ISS MEDM screen was much higher ~12.5 V for PDA and ~13 V for PDB. We tried to lock the loop and as expected with PD voltages that high the loop thought it needed to removed more power from the beam and ran the diffracted power up really high. We immediately unlocked the ISS and began looking into what could be the problem as the MEDM reading on the ISS PDs generally matches the voltmeter reading (I say ""generally matches"" because for reasons unknown to me the ISS does not use the DC out from its PDs it uses a Filter out and ""derives"" the DC and AC PD voltages from that). The PDs appeared to be working correctly and we found no large dark voltages that would indicate a PD failure/malfunction. When we unplugged the Filter output the PD reading in MEDM began to slowly climb but when we blocked the light onto the PDs the MEDM reading went to zero. Looking back at trends we saw the PDs behaving as expected before this most recent NPRO swap only reading these higher values in MEDM with the relock of the PMC an hour or so prior. I had never seen this behavior in the past so wasn't quite sure where the problem could be. Thinking maybe something had gone wrong in either the ISS inner loop servo box or maybe something in the CER we called Fil and asked if he could take a look at the CER electronics for the ISS while we moved on to FSS recovery. It was at this point we found the problem. When the FSS MEDM screen was opened the first thing we saw was one NPRO noise eater (NE) light green and the other red. The green light was our NE enable monitor indicating that the NE toggle was switched ON in the PSL software the red light was our NE monitor which reads the Check output from our NPRO monitor PD that indicates whether or not the NPRO's relaxation oscillation was being supressed. So we had the NE toggled ON but it was clearly not working so we toggled it off and on again. The NE monitor went green and the channel monitoring the relaxation oscillation indicated it was working properly and the ISS PD values on the ISS MEDM screen now read the correct values. So I learned that we have another measure of if the NE is working or not the ISS PD readings on the MEDM screen go higher. Trending back the NE stopped working at ~16:58 PST on Thursday right before Ryan and I left the enclosure for the day. We'll keep an eye on this as right now it's not clear why the NE turned off. At this point everything looked good for the ISS so we moved on to the FSS. FSS: For the FSS we first tried to see if the RefCav would lock with the autolocker it would not. We had to manually tune the NPRO temperature to find a RefCav resonance one was found with a slider value of ~ +0.06. The temperature search ranges were adjsuted to this new value and we tried the autolocker again. While we could see clear flashes the autolocker would not grab lock for some reason. The FSS guardian was paused so it would stop yanking the gains around upon lock acquisition but this did not help the autolocker refused to hold lock for some reason. So I did it manually (from the FSS manual screen manually change NPRO temperature until a resonance flashed through then really quickly move the mouse up to turn the loop on if the loop grabs go back to the FSS MEDM screen and turn on the Temperature loop if not then turn the loop off and try again) which worked. With a locked RefCav we measured a RefCav TPD voltage of ~ 0.84 V. The RefCav Refl spot looked pretty centered so we did not do any alignment tuning. This completed our work in the enclosure so we cleaned up turned the computers and monitors off left the enclosure and put it into Science mode. Outside we scaned the NPRO for mode hop regions and measured TFs of the stabilization loops. NPRO Temperature Scan Now outside the enclosure we set up to scan the NPRO temperatures to check for mode hopping. We took the HV Monitor output from the PMC fieldbox to trigger an oscillscope on the PZT ramp and used the PMC Trans PD to monitor the peaks. We set the PMC's alignment ramp to +/- 7.0 V and a 1 Hz scan rate and monitored the peaks as we tuned the NPRO crystal temperature. We used the slider on the FSS Manual MEDM screen which gives us a total range of approximately +/- 0.8 °C (0.01 on the slider changes the NPRO crystal temperature by roughly 0.01 °C and the slider goes from -0.8 to +0.8). Since we were close to zero on slider sitting at ~ +0.07 we started by moving lower (which reduces the NPRO crystal temperature) our starting crystal temperature as read at the NPRO power supply front panel was 24.22 °C. We got all the way to the negative end of the slider which gave a crystal temperature of 23.38 °C and did not see any evidence of mode hopping on the way down. Heading back up we finally started to see early evidence of mode hopping near the top end of the slider we could clearly see a new forest of peaks show up in the PMC PZT scan and one of them started to grow noticebly as the temperature was further increased. This mode hop region began at a crystal temperature of 24.76 °C and the slider maxed out at 24.91 °C. At this point we still had not fully transitioned through the mode hop region but we did have a peak starting to grow very large indicating that we were almost there. Since we saw no evidence of mode hopping by making the temperature colder we went back to our starting place of 24.22 °C and then reduced the temperature further to the next RefCav resonance below that this resulted in a crystal temperature of 23.96 °C at a slider value around -0.17. Again I had to lock the RefCav manually as the autolocker did not want to grab and hold lock. With all of the stabilization systems locked we moved on to TF measurements. Transfer Functions and Gains We started with the PMC. With the current settings we have a UGF of ~1.6 kHz and 60° of phase margin see first attachment. Everything looked good so we left the PMC alone. For the ISS we have a UGF of ~45 kHz and a phase margin of 37.5° see second attachment. Again everything look normal here so we left the ISS alone. For the FSS we started with a Common gain of 15 dB. Everything looked OK but since we had seen some potential zero crossings that like to hide in the longer range scans we did a ""zoomed in"" scan from 100 kHz to 1 MHz. Sure enough there were a couple peaks in the 500 kHz to 600 kHz range that were pretty close to a zero crossing. We lowered the Common gain to 14 dB to move them away from the potential crossing the third attachment shows this zoomed in area with the Common gain at 14 dB and the peaks in question are clearly visible. With this Common gain we have a UGF of ~378 kHz with ~60° of phase margin see fourth attachment we took this TF out to 10MHz to check for any weirdness at higher frequency and did not see anything immediately concerning. To finish we took a look at the PZT/EOM crossover (around 20 kHz) to set the Fast gain. The final attachment shows this measurement (a spectrum of IN1) at a Fast gain of 5 dB this looks OK so we left the Fast gain as is. At this point the NPRO swap was complete the PSL was fully recovered and we handed things over to the commissioning team for IFO recovery. We still need to look at PMC mode matching and will do so during future Tuesday maintenance periods. This closes WP 12210 .

Extremely quiet shift. Intentionally dropped out of OBSERVING twice: To let Vicky tune SQZ while L1 was down. Sadly this did not seem to improve range. We were COMISSIONING between 04:19 UTC and 04:31 UTC (12 mins) To damp EY Mode 1. Vicky noticed DCPDs were growing and asked if Violins were high. Upon trending (screenshot) it seemed that EY Mode 1 had been increasing for the whole lock. I had to go to DAMP_VIOLINS_SIMPLE which took us out of OBSERVING between 04:53 UTC and 05:12 UTC (19 mins). Applying the nominal gain of 0.1 did not work so I played around with the gain increasing it by a further 0.1 and decreasing by 0.05 both in the negative and positive. While there were some short term successes overall my attempt did not help with counts always seeming worse than with nominal guardian damping (which is 0 gain). Not wanting to spend too much time out of OBSERVING I re-set the gain to 0 and gave guardian the reigns again. They're ever so slowly going down. My guess is that these violins are being rung up by the increasing secondary microseism which started noticeably increasing around 8 hours ago. It is about to cross the 0.9 threshold line. The primary microseism is also elevated as of 13 hrs ago. EY Mode 15 is also elevated but judging from the 1000(ish) hz lines on DARM and the value on the cts it is by a negligible amount (still below 10E-17 ASD) so I did not attempt to damp this. For our recent locks it seems as though the damping works up to 1-2 hrs into locking but then Mode 1 turns around and starts increasing in counts. I believe some more investigation into this is needed to perhaps find a better angle/gain to damp. (screenshot 2).

Saturday Calibration was run (coordinated with LLO). Overall locking was fairly easy although the ALS took a bit of time (not bad) and DRMI locking was a little tough and needed PRMI/CHECK_MICH_FRINGES. But after that locking has been automated. LOG: 1633 Lockloss (after 5hr55min lock) Locking Notes: Green arms: x-arm looked off in pitch and mostly improved via TMSx in +pit but then let INCREASE FLASHES run for both arms. ALSy would have its alignment driven off so quickly took down and tweaked up mainly via tmsy (still not great but made it) DRMI: Had to go to PRMI. Still looked off so touched PRM and then BS in pitch (due to AS flashes) & it locked. During ASC offload AS camera went from pitch misalignment to yaw misalignment on the camera and it stuck with that as ASC offloaded. For DRMI eventually locked after 4+min but.... 1702 DRMI Lockloss (non-DOWN) 1757 Back to NLN 1921 Incoming M5.9 Fiji EQ alert---No issues riding through it. 2036-2037 Accidental Drop from OBSERVING due to Operator Error For the next lock there is currently an ISC_LOCK notification saying ""ALS_XARM: STOLEN by USER"" 2100-2132 Calibration 2221 Lockloss (after a 4hr24min lock) ALS locking once again was not smooth. Required several rounds of INCREASE FLASHES. And even after that when the arms would lock they would have noticeable oscillations (for the y-arm the powers had a 5sec period oscillation which would cause a lockloss) But ISC LOCK eventually moved on. DRMI had flashes but similar to last lock it wasn't quite there. I took H1 straight to CHECK MICH FRINGES after a few minutes and rest of ISC_LOCK was automated. 2329 OBSERVING 2349 PI24 begins ringing up & was damped down within a couple minutes.

These changes aimed to investigate whether we could reduce the amplitude of a peak around 540 Hz observed in DARM which we suspect may be associated with input jitter noise coupling into DARM. At approximately 17:23 UTC we began by reducing the ring heater (RH) power per segment on ITMY from 0.53 W to 0.50 W. After one hour around 18:24 UTC we increased the power on the ETMX ring heaters per segment from 0.2 W to 0.3 W. Finally at about 19:52 UTC we changed the TCS setting of the ETMY RH per segment from 0.11 W to 0.05 W. While adjusting the RH settings we monitored the effects on various parameters including sideband power buildup in the PRC the interferometer reflectivity and the optical gain. We would expect these values to be stable if all variables remained constant. Here are some notable observations: 1) The optical gain increased by approximately 1% following the RH changes. 2) The PRC power buildups at 9 MHz and 45 MHz decreased by approximately 1.5% to 2%. 3) There may have been a slight improvement in optical gain of less than 1%. 4) The power in the Power Recycling Cavity (POP_A_LF) and the interferometer reflected power (REFL_A_LF) increased although the effect was minimal for both signals. 5) Power at the AS port as measured by the AS_C QPD showed a decrease with actual counts dropping about 200 to 210 representing a reduction of around 5%. Overall the changes in the different signals observed in the first plot were relatively small across most buildups with the optical gain showing a slight increase or remaining stable during the RH setting changes for ITMY ETMX and ETMY. In the second attachment we present the DARM data between 520 and 900 Hz along with the changes in the height of the hump around 540 Hz following each adjustment to the relative humidity (RH) settings. It appears that the most significant effect on the amplitude of the 540 Hz hump occurred after the reduction of the ETMY RH power (indicated by the blue trace). This effect was more pronounced compared to the changes observed 1 hour after the IY RH adjustment (green) and 1 hour after the EX RH adjustment (orange/brown). In the third attachment we present the DARM jitter coherence. The power spectra for the DARM and IMC WFS A are shown in the second and third plots because they serve as the best indicators for measuring input jitter. The first plot displays the coherence between IMC WFS A and DARM as well as the coherence between PEM PSL PERISCOPE and DARM. We observe approximately 0.7 coherence between the IMC WFS A I PIT and the PEM PSL PERISCOPE X with DARM and around 0.5 coherence between the IMC WFS A I YAW and DARM.

Five seconds after the lock loss the MC2 suspension watchdog tripped and remained in this state until I received a one-hour lost lock call which required human intervention. Microseism noise is slightly higher than the last time the interferometer (IFO) lost lock and subsequently relocked so I wonder if this contributes to the IFO's difficulty in locking as quickly as before. Please refer to the attached document for more details. Over the last hour the IFO has struggled to reach a low noise state. It lost lock twice during the TURN_ON_DHARD phase and once during the SWITCH_ESD_TO_LOW_NOISE state. Currently the IFO is attempting to lock again and I hope it will succeed this time.

There are a few more plots to support Huyen's statement that it doesn't seem much better. I've attached 3 pdfs- The first is for a large microseism before the second is a big set of plot from after and the third set is the right place to look first to compare the before/ after. The before/after has 2 sets of 4 plots. The ""after"" time is for a large microseism - this is sept 27 2024 7:00 UTC - the IFO has finally locked after such large microseismic motion that it could not acquire lock. plots 1-4 are from ""before"" and 5-8 are ""after"" Plot 1/5 - Ground motion ASD. The microseism is big. Plot 2/6 - The top trace is the table Z velocity seem by the GS-13s. subplots 2 & 3 are the residual velocity for X & Y. In the ""before"" time the motion on the 50 sec time scale is pretty terrible. It's bettern in plot 6 for the After time. BUT - the motion at the microseism in Z and the residual at the microsiesm for X&Y are about the same. The ""after"" plot on pg 6 shows clear residual (excess) motion for X&Y at the microseism. Here you can see that the level of Z motion and the level of X & Y residual is about the same. This is consistent with a 0.1 rad/meter coupling from Z into rX and rY for the GS-13s - because g/w^2 is about 10 meter/rad at 160 mHz. This 10% is consistent with the TFs in the next 2 plots but not really consistent with the expectations of reduced coupling we should get from the precision calibration Huyen did. Note - These plots are in Band Limited velocity (nm/sec). There is a lowpass filter at 30 mHz and a highpass filter at 1 Hz to help emphasize the microseism. In the full plot sets you can see that in tilt the signal on the CPS and GS-13 is sensor noise limited below about 100 mHz and above about 1 Hz (pgs 49 50 52 53) Plot 3/7 - TF from GS-13 Z to GS-13 RX. around the microseism there is excellent coherence and the TF is around 0.1 to 0.25 between 0.1 and 0.3 Hz plot 4/8 - TF from GS-13Z to GS-13 RY - very much like the RX TFs.

There are no new points for ITMX since the coherence for the bias drive bias off measurement was 0.07 which is below the threshold of 0.1 that we have set. We had previously concluded ( 79597 ) that this may be because of no charge build-up on the test mass assuming that we are calculating our coherences correctly. Previous issue with measurement processing script: There had been some issues with processing the In-Lock SUS Charge Measurements for this past week so I looked at the script and was able to fix the issue. Originally the way that the script would figure out whether it needs to run a measurement or whether it had already been processed is that it would make a list of all the measurements that occurred during the entered time period (default is the past month) and a list of all processed measurements that occurred during the entered time period and then uses nested for loops to check whether a processed file existed for each data file. That normally works fine but in this case the last time we had gotten and processed measurements was over one month ago so when the script tried making a list of the processed files from within the last month there weren't any and the list was blank. Then when it tried to iterate over each data file and then over each processed file it would skip the entire processed file iteration because the list was empty. The range over which it looks for unprocessed files can be changed or set to look at all files in each directory but that shouldn't be required in this/most cases so I edited the script. I added in a catch for when the coefficient file list is empty for it to run all measurements in the data directory list.

We set the suspension watchdog thresholds to values between 100 and 300 µm but these values were set arbitrarily since there was no way to previously see how far the stages move during different scenarios. We had upped a few of the thresholds after having some suspensions trip when they probably shouldn't have and this is a continuation of that. During the large earthquake that hit us on December 5th 2024 18:46 UTC all ISI watchdogs tripped as well as some of the stages on several suspensions. After a cursory look all suspensions that tripped only had either the bottom or bottom+penultimate stage trip meaning that with the exception of the single suspensions the others' M1 stage damping should have stayed on. We wanted to go through and check whether the trips may have just been because of the movement from the ISIs tripping. If that is the case we want to raise the suspension watchdog thresholds for those stages so that these suspensions don't trip every single time their ISI trips especially if the amount that they are moving is still not very large. Suspension stages that tripped: Triples: - MC3 M3 - PR3 M2 M3 - SRM M2 M3 - SR2 M2 M3 Singles: - IM1 M1 - OFI M1 - TMSX M1 MC3 (M3) ( ndscope1 ) When the earthquake hit and we lost lock all stages were moving due to the earthquake but once HAM2 ISI tripped 5 seconds after the lockloss the rate at which the OSEMs were moving quickly accelerated so the excess motion looks to mainly be due to the ISI trip ( ndscope2 ). Stage Original WD threshold Max BLRMS reached after lockloss New WD threshold M1 150 86 150 (unchanged) M2 150 136 175 M3 150 159 200 PR3 (M2 M3) ( ndscope3 ) Looks to be the same issue as with MC3. Stage Original WD threshold Max BLRMS reached after lockloss New WD threshold M1 150 72 150 (unchanged) M2 150 162 200 M3 150 151 200 SRM (M2 M3) ( ndscope4 ) Once again the OSEMs are moving after the lockloss due to the earthquake but the rate they were moving at greatly increased once HAM5 saturated and the ISI watchdogs tripped. Stage Original WD threshold Max BLRMS reached after lockloss New WD threshold M1 150 84 150 (unchanged) M2 150 165 200 M3 150 174 225 SR2 (M2 M3) ( ndscope5 ) Again the OSEMs are moving after the lockloss due to the earthquake but the rate they were moving at greatly increased once HAM4 saturated and the ISI watchdogs tripped. Stage Original WD threshold Max BLRMS reached after lockloss New WD threshold M1 150 102 150 (unchanged) M2 150 182 225 M3 150 171 225 IM1 (M1) ( ndscope6 ) Again the OSEMs are moving after the lockloss due to the earthquake but the rate they were moving at greatly increased once HAM2 saturated and the ISI watchdogs tripped. Stage Original WD threshold Max BLRMS reached after lockloss New WD threshold M1 150 175 225 OFI (M1) ( ndscope7 ) Again the OSEMs are moving after the lockloss due to the earthquake but the rate they were moving at greatly increased once HAM5 saturated and the ISI watchdogs tripped. Stage Original WD threshold Max BLRMS reached after lockloss New WD threshold M1 150 209 250 TMSX (M1) ( ndscope8 ) This one seems a bit questionable - it looks like some of the OSEMs were already moving quite a bit before the ISI tripped and there isn't as much of a clear place where they started moving more once the ISI had tripped( ndscope9 ). I will still be raising the suspension trip threshold for this one just because it doesn't need to be raised very much and is within a reasonable range.

I trended the ALSX channels alongside the EX VEA temperatures and it looks like a couple of the temperatures went down section D down by almost one degree F right around when we started having crystal frequency issues. The wind also was blowing into the VEA which we know since the dust counts were high then. I believe it's possible that the wind was cooling down the air in the part of the VEA near where we have the ALS box and changing the temperature of the crystal enough to affect the beatnote. I only have this one screenshot right now ( ndscope ) but I had trended back a few months and seen a possible correlation between when we get into the CHECK_CRYSTAL_FREQUENCY state for ALSX the temperature inside the EX VEA and the dust counts indicating wind entering the VEA. It's hard to know for sure especially because the air/wind outside is now much colder than it was a couple months ago but it would be interesting to know the location of the D section and look for these correlations more closely. tagging ISC LOG: 22:15 started an initial alignment 22:40 initial alignment done relocking - ALSX beatnote issue - CHECK_CRYSTAL_FREQUENCY - toggled force/no force - finally caught with no force - ALSX beatnote issue again - toggled force/no force and enable/disable 00:01 Put ifo in DOWN since we can't get past DRMI due to the high microseism 00:29 tried relocking 01:06 back to DOWN 02:38 Trying relocking again Start Time System Name Location Lazer_Haz Task Time End 23:03 PEM Robert LVEA YES Finish setting up for Monday 23:48 ISC ,"{'term': 'H1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81673,oli.patane@ligo.org

Since 10/16/2024 there have been 10 instances where M3 WD trips during SRC align during initial alignment which have caused a total loss of 1hr and 49 mins of locking time. While this isn't a lot the trending WD trips for SRM shows that this is a more recent occurrence. Out of the 31 total M3 SRM WD trips since start of O4b (and not counting vent) 12 happened in the last 5 weeks with 10 of these being during initial alignment (i.e. this type of trip). Since the rise of this issue we have gone through a total of 112 initial alignments meaning it's occurred in 9% of initial alignments. Doesn't sound like a lot but if guardian has an initial alignment during an OWL shift this suggests a 1/10 chance of being woken up just to press ""untrip"". Sometimes M3 is too rung up in this state that untripping takes 20 mins but other times it only takes 1-2 mins.

Next Steps: The possible cause per a last convo with TJ was that guardian thinks that SRC is aligned when actually it is locked to the wrong mode causing the SRM controls to go awry when re-misaligning during initial alignment - so just rehash that conversation when possible.

TJ and I were investigating it earlier and had early thoughts that SRM was catching on the wrong mode during SRC alignment in ALIGN_IFO either during the re-alignment of SRM (pre-SRC align) or after the re-misalignment of SRM. This results in the guardian thinking that SRC is aligned which results in saturations and trips because it's actually not. Again we think this is the case as of 11/25 but still investigating.

In any LIGO cluster terminal or Jupyter we can use igwn-py kernel and import just the following dependency:from spectrums Import *# define a time segment object:time_seg = time_segment()In the prompt this will ask to enter a ref_time (reference time) this would be gps time when OSEMs were known to have no anomalies. Once pressed enter it will ask for check_time this would be another gps time which is being checked against ref_time. Finally it will ask to enter duration. For a long duration this might take a long time to execute. Keeping duration =180 (in seconds) is a reasonable choice.This will create a time segment object as a dictionary.Now we can either check the OSEM fluctuations directly by running the following command:host = 'nds.ligo-wa.caltech.edu'osem_fluctuations(time_segments = time_seg host=host)This will show us available OSEMs and we can enter at least one or a list of OSEMs that we wish to investigate. It may take a few minutes to get all the plots. Checking individual OSEMs might be time consuming a quick alternative is to check their BLRM values first:check_blrms(time_segments = time_seg host=host fs = 256 lowcut = 15 highcut = 20 threshold = None)Runing this function allows us to enter either one or a list of OSEMs like before to have their BLRM values printed.

Oberling R. Short This afternoon Jason and I started to look into why the FSS has been struggling to relock itself recently. In short once the autolocker finds a RefCav resonance it's been able to grab it but loses it after about a second. This happens repeatedly sometimes taking up to 45 minutes for the autolocker to finally grab and hold resonance on its own (which led me to do this manually twice yesterday). We first noticed the autolocker struggling when recovering the FSS after the most recent NPRO swap on November 22nd which led Jason to manually lock it in that instance. While looking at trends of when the autolocker both fails and is successful in locking the RefCav we noticed that the fastmon channel looks the most different between the two cases. In a successful RefCav lock ( attachment 1 ) the fastmon channel will start drifting away from zero as the PZT works to center on the resonance but once the temperature loop turns on the signal is brought back and eventually settles back around zero. In unsuccessful RefCav lock attempts (attachments 2 and 3 ) the fastmon channel will still drift away but then lose resonance once the signal hits +/-13V (the limit of the PZT as set by the electronics within the TTFSS box) before the temploop is able to turn on. I also looked back to a successful FSS lock with the NPRO installed before this one (before the problems with the autolocker started attachment 4 ) and the behavior looks much the same as with successful locks with the current NPRO. It seems that with this NPRO for some reason the PZT is frequently running out of range when trying to center on the RefCav resonance before the temploop can turn on to help but it sometimes gets lucky. Jason and I took some time familiarizing ourselves with the autolocker code (written in C and unchanged in over a decade) to give us a better idea of what it's doing. At this point we're still not entirely sure what about this NPRO is causing the PZT to run out of range but we do have some ideas of things to try during a maintenance window to make the FSS lock faster: Reduce delay turning on temploop (state 2 currently 1.0 sec) Increase wait time for mode to be centered (state 1 currently 0.1 sec LLO uses 5.0 sec) Allow more voltage to PZT (requires using newer version of TTFSS box) Current TTFSS limits PZT voltage to 13V-15V max HV capable of supplying up to 65V PZT capable of running up to 65V-100V ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81780,ryan.short@ligo.org

43676,H1 ISC - Test mass motion from ASC drives,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81769,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Wed, 11 Dec 2024 15:25:12 -0800","This alog presents the first steps I am taking into answering the question: ""what is the calibrated residual test mass motion from the ASC?"" As a reminder the arm alignment control is run in the common/differential hard/soft basis so we have eight total loops governing the angular motion of the test masses: pitch and yaw for differential hard/soft and common hard/soft. These degrees of freedom are diagonalized in actuation via the ASC drive matrix. The signals from each of these ASC degrees of freedom are then sent to each of the four test masses where the signal is fed ""up"" from the input of the TST ISC filter banks through the PUM/UIM/TOP locking filters banks (I annotated this screenshot of the ITM suspension medm for visualization). No pitch or yaw actuation is sent to the TST or UIM stages at Hanford. The ASC drive to the pum is filtered through some notches/bandstops for various suspension modes. The ASC drive to the TOP acquires all of these notches and bandstops and an additional integrator and low pass filter meaning that the top mass actuates in angle at very low frequency only (sub 0.5 Hz). Taking this all into account involves a lot of work so to just get something off the ground I am only thinking about ASC drive to the PUM in this post. With a little more time I can incorporate the drive to the top mass stage as well. Thinking only about the PUM makes this a ""simple"" problem: we know exactly what the ASC drive is in counts- we just measure the ""H1:ASC-[DOF]_[P/Y]_OUT_DQ"" channel We propagate drive that to each test mass knowing the drive matrix we have set screenshots of the pitch matrix and yaw matrix We calibrate this from drive counts to Newton*meters knowing the drive calibration from G1100968 for PUM: 40 V /2**20 ct [DAC] * 0.268 mA / V [drive strength] * 0.0309 N / A [force coeff] * 70.7 mm [lever arm] pit/yaw lever arm is the same for the PUM I conveniently chose a time from before the ETMX DAC change to avoid thinking too hard about the DAC counts We transform this N*m PUM drive to radians of test mass motion using the PUM-TST state space suspension model transfer function which is calibrated into real units I did all of this in python so I used Kevin's exported quad state space model found here: T2300299 I used the damped model which applies the ETMX top mass damping filters I have done just this to achieve the four plots I have attached to this alog. These plots show the ITM and ETM test mass motion in rad/rtHz from each degree of freedom and the overall radian RMS value. That is each trace is showing you exactly how much radians of motion each ASC degree of freedom is sending to the test mass through the PUM drive. The drive matrix value is the same in magnitude for each ITM and each ETM meaning that the ""ITM"" plot is true for both ITMX and ITMY (the drives might differ by an overall sign though). Since I am just looking at the PUM I also didn't include the drive notches. Once I add in the top mass drive I will make sure I capture the various drive filters properly. Some commentary: These plots make it very evident how different the drive is from each ASC degree of freedom. This is confusing because in principle we know that the ""HARD"" and ""SOFT"" plants are the same for common and differential and could use the same control design. However we know that the sensor noise at the REFL WFS which controls CHARD is different than the sensor noise at the AS WFS that control DHARD so even with exact same controller we would see different overall drives. We also know that we don't use the same control design for each DOF due to the sensor noise limitations and also the randomness of commissioning that has us updating each ASC controller at different times for different reasons. For example the soft loops both run on the TMS QPDs but still have different drive levels. Some action items: besides continuing the process of getting all the drives from all stages properly calibrated we can start thinking again about our ASC design and how to improve it. I think two standout items are the SOFT P and CHARD Y noise above 10 Hz on these plots. Also the fact that the overall RMS from each loop varies is something that warrants more investigation. I think this is probably related to the differing control designs sensor noise and noise from things like HAM1 motion or PR3 bosems. So one thing I can do is project the PR3 damping noise that we think dominates the REFL WFS RMS into test mass motion.

A moment or so after there is a glitch in those channels there is a range drop in DARM.

I completed a series of LASSO investigations around this time in the hopes that such a sharp feature would make it easier for LASSO to identify correlations. I find a number of trend channels that have drastic changes at the same time as this turn-off point related to TCS-ITMY_CO2 ALS-Y_WFS and SUS-MC3_M1. The runs I completed are linked here: LASSO run of the first half of Dec 11 with the sensemon range as the primary channel LASSO run of times near the turn-off point with TCS-ITMY_CO2 as the primary channel LASSO run of times near the turn-off point with the sensemon range as the primary channel Run #1 was a generic run of LASSO in the hopes of identifying a correlation. While no channel was highlighted as strongly correlated to the entire time period this run does identify H1:TCS-ITMY_CO2_QPD_B_SEG2_OUTPUT (rank 11) and H1:TCS-ITMY_CO2_QPD_B_SEG2_INMON (rank 15) as having a drastic feature at the turn-off point (example figure ). Based on this information I launched targeted runs #2 and #3. Run #2 is a run of LASSO using H1:TCS-ITMY_CO2_QPD_B_SEG2_OUTPUT as the primary channel to correlate against. This was designed to identify any additional channels that may show a drastic change in behavior at the same time. Channels of interest from this run include H1:ALS-Y_WFS_B_DC_SEG3_OUT16 ( example figure ) and H1:ALS-Y_WFS_B_DC_MTRX_Y_OUTMON ( example figure ). SEISMON channels were also found to be correlated but this is likely a coincidence. Run #3 targets the same turn-on point but with the standard sensemon range as the primary channel. This run revealed an additional channel with a change in behavior at the time of interest H1:SUS-MC3_M1_DAMP_P_INMON ( example figure ). Based on these runs the TCS-IMTY_CO2 and ALS-Y_WFS channels are the best leads for additional investigations into the source of this glitching.

43690,H1 PSL - PMC Heater Calibration and Actuation Efficiency Analysis,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81756,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Tue, 10 Dec 2024 20:44:07 -0800",[Jason Masayuki] Summary The PMC heater calibration was performed last week (Tuesday). The calibration involved adjusting the temperature loop set point and monitoring the corresponding changes in PMC temperature and length. The results were validated using previous measurements and compared to similar evaluations at LLO. Additionally the necessity of the heater for JAC operations was assessed highlighting it would be needed for long term operation. Details PMC Heater Calibration The calibration of the PMC heater was conducted. The PMC remained locked while the temperature loop set point was adjusted from the usual 3.7V to 1.7V. This adjustment corresponds to a PMC length change of 0.30 μm based on a prior measurement ( alog entry 81385 ). A PMC temperature change of 0.023 K was recorded using the thermometer. From this result the thermal expansion coefficient was calculated as: 0.30 μm / 0.023 K = 13 μm/K This result is consistent with the thermal expansion coefficient of aluminum 22e-6/K and the approximate PMC length of 0.5 m. No significant changes in heater output were detected before and after the set point adjustment. First Plot Description: Top panel: PZT input calibrated for PMC length. Middle panel: PMC temperature measured with the thermometer. Bottom panel: Heater output with histograms shown for the middle and bottom panels. Reference to LLO Calibration To further calibrate the PMC heater the LLO heater calibration ( alog entry 51467 attached plot ) was used as a reference. At LLO heater input changes from 2.5V to 4V resulted in PMC temperature changes from 292.2 K to 291.125 K indicating a heater efficiency of \(0.67 \ \text{K}/\text{V}\). Using this efficiency the PMC expansion rate per heater voltage was calculated as: 13 μm/K × 0.67 K/V = 8.7 μm/V Monthly Drift Analysis With this calibration the monthly heater output was evaluated. Second Plot Description: Top panel: Heater-induced temperature actuation (left axis) and the corresponding PMC expansion (right axis). Bottom panel: Required PZT input for equivalent actuation without the heater. Periodic large spikes were observed daily. However since each spike occurred within approximately 10 seconds as shown in the attached screenshot these spikes are not attributed to actual temperature changes. A moving median (red line) was applied to highlight the spikes. Note that this moving median is not an ideal representation as the extracted data is already averaged over 1-minute intervals. However it is still useful for illustrating the spikes. Despite the spikes the heater compensated for a length change equivalent to approximately 500 V in PZT input is typical day-time drift but sometime it can drift more than 1000V in a day. A 10-day analysis of LLO PMC showed no spikes and the results were consistent with LHO data. Result is shown in the third plot as same structure as the second plot. Implications for JAC Operations The PZT can be railed in a day from this measurement so we would need the heater for JAC operation. Additional Observations Spikes observed at LHO caused glitches in transmitted power as shown in the attached plot and may require resolution. Redesigning the filters could potentially mitigate these anomalies. PSL ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81756,masayuki.nakano@ligo.org

This beam has been clipped at least since the O4 break due to various reasons (in this particular alog we tried to fix it but then undid the fix I'm adding here so we have a general time reference for when we first noticed the problem: 76291 ). As a result the PRG calibration for O4b has been fishy since it is normalized by the IM4 trans QPD power. Today with the beam properly centered I checked the PRG calibration to make sure it's still good. Craig did this after ITMY was replaced: 58327 . I followed his same steps with help from Ryan S and Sheila. First we ran initial alignment on the y arm which uses the green camera references. We waited until that alignment was converged and then stepped through the input_align_yarm states in the ALIGN_IFO guardian. I recorded the IM4 trans value as well as the y arm transmission value. When we run a normal initial alignment we lock input align with the x arm so I used that opportunity to similarly record the x arm transmission value and IM4 trans. As a note: the green input alignment references are set when we converge the full IFO ASC therefore I believe the single arm alignment after we run the green initial alignment is probably very close to the full IFO alignment. Then we paused in DARM_TO_DC_READOUT in the ISC LOCK guardian this is just after all the full IFO ASC converges at 2W. I grabbed the x and y arm transmission values and IM4 trans. Channels: H1:IMC-IM4_TRANS_NSUM_OUT16 H1:LSC-TR_X_NORM_OUT16 H1:LSC_TR_Y_NORM_OUT16 Single arm lock values: Y-arm trans: 0.91 IM4 trans: 1.95 X-arm trans: 1.01 IM4 trans: 1.98 Full lock values: Y-arm trans: 1684 X-arm trans: 1708 IM4 trans: 1.98 Calculation: PRM transmission = 0.031 PRG = Tp * Y-arm trans (full ifo) / Y-arm trans (yarm only) * Input power (yarm only) / Input power (full ifo) (copied directly from Craig's alog) PRG from Y arm = 56.5 PRG from X arm = 54.0 PRG reported from H1:LSC-PR_GAIN_OUT16 at the 2W lock time: 54 Therefore I think our PRG calibration is correct.

Today Sheila and I discussed locking without the FE triggering at all and just having the ALIGN_IFO node see good flashes and turn on the necessary filters and banks. I tried this out today but I wasn't able to get it to lock any more reliably than what we have now. No matter the method it would seem to catch with low AS_A values ~2500 on NSUM vs the normal 5000. From here SRM would start to be driven before it would realize that it wasn't quite locked. I tried adding some code in ACQUIRE_SRY to try to turn on and off the SRM M1 LOCK L input and the SRCL FM4 filters and even clear the history if necessary but this didn't work without long settling periods between attempts. I ended up keeping the ISC_library.is_locked('SRY') looking as AS_A_DC_NSUM_OUTPUT > 4000. This value is a bit higher but safer. It will let the node run through Down and reset drives integrators and let SRM settle a bit. I don't think this is a fix barely even a band aid. It will need some more thought on how to only catch on the correct mode. ,"{'term': 'H1 GRD', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81747,thomas.shaffer@ligo.org

These Thermoflex1400 chillers have their flow rate adjusted by opening or closing a 3 way valve at the back of the chiller. for both X and Y chillers these have been in the full open position with the lever pointed straight up. The Y chiller has been running with 4.0gpm so our only change was a lower flow rate. The X chiller has been at 3.7gpm already and the manual states that these chillers shouldn't be ran below 3.8gpm. Though this was a small note in the manual and could be easily missed. Since the flow couldn't be increased via the 3 way valve on back I didn't want to lower it further and left it as is. Two questions came from this: Why are we running so close to the 3.8gpm minimum? Why is the flow rate for the X chiller so low? The flow rate has been consistent for the last year+ so I don't suspect that the pumps are getting worn out. As far back as I can trend they have been around 4.0 and 3.7 with some brief periods above or below. TCS ,"{'term': 'H1 PEM', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81745,thomas.shaffer@ligo.org

In production it was replaced with a W2275 (aka oaf FE). Please see Jonathan's alog for details. After h0epics was moved its iocs were started by hand as per wiki instructions: dust monitors (lvea lab ey ex dr) weather stations (ex ey mx my) and 3ifo dewpoint sensor. WP12236 New RGC and Timing Card h1omc0 Jonathan Erik EJ Marc Daniel Dave: h1omc0 was upgraded to a custom RCG5.30 and a new LIGO Timing Card (ver1589). This will permit changing the Duotone frequency from 960961Hz to 19201921Hz in conjection with LLO next week. Erik verified the duotone is currently unchanged at 960961Hz. Please see Erik's alog for details. The RCG upgrade of h1iopomc0 added one slow channel to the DAQ INI (H1:FEC-179_TIMING_CARD_TEMP_DEG_C). A DAQ restart was required which permitted an EDC change for several pending WPs (marked as *). WP12243 Slow Controls Timing Card Version Check Daniel Daniel changed the slow-controls Beckhoff code to permit the following versions of the LIGO timing card in the FE IO-Chassis Ver Desc 496 Standard first version timing card 1000 New LIGO DAC timing card 1589 Variable DuoTone frequency timing card The code was restarted at 10:19. This fixed the persistant EX timing error due to h1susex TCver=1000 and preempted a corner station h1omc0 error with TCver=1589. WP12164 Add new Guardian PCALX_STAT channels to DAQ* Tony TJ Dave: The new PCALX_STAT guardian node's DAQ channels were added to the EDC as part of the DAQ restart. WP12195 Add missing CDSRFM slow channel to DAQ* Dave: A new H1EPICS_CDSRFM.ini was loaded adding the missing channel H1:CDS-RFM_LRS_EX2CS_CHCNT WP12185 add VACSTAT slow channels to DAQ* Dave: A new H1EPICS_VACSTAT.ini added the new state channels to the DAQ. CDS Hardware Status IOC Erik Dave: Following the upgrade of h1omc0's timing card the CDS HW stat reported problems with this card. We found that one unused bit in the LPTC_STATUS PV was unset in h1omc0 and set in all the other front ends including h1susex. All FE except h1omc0 LPTC_STATUS = 0x4fbf ee00 (bit 16 set) h1omc0 LPTC_STATUS = 0x4fbe ee00 (bit 16 unset) Now that Daniel has fixed the TCver error in EX the temporary code in cds_status_ioc.py to verify the only EX error is the TCver error was removed. DAQ Restart Jonathan Erik EJ Dave: The DAQ was restarted primarily for the h1iopomc0 INI change due to its RCG upgrade. Several EDC changes which have been waiting for target-of-opportunity were also done. This was a messy DAQ restart. Adding h1omc0 to the custom RCG boot server h1vmboot0 inadvertently changed the DAQ FE list to only include two frontends h1susex and h1omc0. When the 0-leg was started initially DC0 looked good but then we noticed that on the CDS overview only the DC0 EPICS channels for omc0 and susex were connecting and Jonathan found GDS0 had lost a lot of channels. Around this time I also restarted the EDC on h1susauxb123 and also found that the expected number of channels was down by about 1000. At this time FW0 was writing tiny frames (only two frontends). DC0s DAQ configuration was fixed and the 0-leg was restarted. At this point the EDC was out of sync so it was restarted. This then generated a new H1EDC.ini which necessitated a third and final 0-leg restart (plus another GDS0). The 1-leg restart was a single restart with a GDS1 restart also needed. Change of RCG reporting color on CDS Overview Dave: We now have two front end systems in production which are running with a custom version of the RCG. To highlight this I have changed the non-standard-RCG indicator color from purple to black on the CDS Overview.

Dave Jonathan] h1omc0 was upgraded to support alternative duotone frequencies. A new parameter was added to the iop model h1iopomc0 'duotone_frequency' currently set to '960' which configures the duotone frequency to 960/961 Hz the standard frequencies. The h1omc0 front end was moved from a the primary bootserver h1vmboot1 to the secondary bootserver h1vmboot0 using changes to the puppet configuration. All models for h1omc0 were built and installed from RCG source rather than packages. The git commit of the RCG source is tagged as 'h1_2024_12_10_variable_duotone'. The omc0 front end and io chassis were shut down. The timing card SN S2101117 was replaced with SN S2101084 which had newer firmware version 1589 that supports alternative duotone frequencies. The IO chassis and front-end were restarted. A few problems were encountered: Running puppet on the secondary bootserver overwrote the DAQ master template and some EDC INI files. The master file problem was revealed in the DAQ overview where most of the front ends were reporting no channels. The EDC overwrite showed up as too few total EDC channels. Running the puppet configuration on the production server re-enabled DHCP for hosts that were supposed to boot from the secondary bootserver. These had to be manually commented out from the DHCPD configuration then the service restarted. To change the duotone to 1920 Hz edit the h1ipomc0 model set 'duotone_frequency=1920' in the parameter block save the model.

Unsure of the lock loss cause as maintenance activities had started. We aimed to see if the 59Hz coupling to DARM peak changed (needs ~20 minutes+ of data) but the accelerators showed that by increasing the CO2 power dumped in the water cooled beam dump the load on the chillers changed and the 59Hz peak moved ~0.1Hz which means that it would be very difficult to see in DARM. 15:41 Turned CO2X and CO2Y power output down to 0W. 15:51 closed iris at bottom of CO2Y periscope (there is no place in VP for guillotine) 16:01 onwards Robert was doing backscatter tests on HAM3 making IFO glitches/noise 1624 Opened CO2Y irirs IFO lost lost lock In attached plot can see that the SQZ (especially at high frequency) got worse without CO2s. The SQZ ASC also changed the alignment mainly in YAW does that mean that the CO2s need some alignment improvements in YAW? Looking at HWS signals the optics substrate absorption changes as expected and started to level out although the simulation didn't expect them too level out yet. In future to repeat this test we could dump to 1.7W going into DARM using a normal beam-dump to dump the 1.7W before the periscope so that the load on the chiller isn't changed but the CO2 is not on being injected and anything that could backscatter light after the periscope is blocked. Alternatively we could shake the table. Still the VPs themselves could be a source of scatter as are only AR coated at 10.6um meaning they reflect up to 15% of 1064nm per surface DCC D1100439 .

My hypothesis was that the Camera servos were coupling the SOFT loops to the HARD loops in a parallel configuration such that they are adding (can be additive of subtractive) and I did an ON/OFF test measuring DHARD Y and CHARD Y with camera servo filter that reduced the gain around 0.4 Hz by 20dB. The DHARD Y loop has much higher gain than CHARD. I found no evidence of coupling there and it may be just the coupling is smaller than I had modelled. As for CHARD Y I projected would have a UGF at around 0.4 Hz [ 73035 ] but I see some notch like feature that could be what I am looking for but in my stupidity I only have a measurement with my altered Camera servo control (so no ON/OFF test). I'd want to double check if this feature changes with camera servo control change. Regardless of whether I am hypothesising anything sane this is a very strange feature and definitely a sign of some unwanted coupling.

43766,L1 ISC - Comment to ESD control spectra during ALS_DIFF,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=74466,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Wed, 11 Dec 2024 16:50:51 -0600",Some commentary on this data with implications for the required ESD range for the 100 kg test mass. First some explanation of the interferometer state during this time series. At the beginning of the time series plot when the ESD signals are flat the ALS system is providing only common mode feedback to the main laser frequency. The ALS differential control starts just after -19m when the differential feedback is applied to the two ETM ESDs only. The main signal content here is the microseism (5 sec period when this data was taken the microseism was relatively high). Some time before -18m the ALS DIFF feedback is also applied to the UIMs and the ALS DIFF bandwidth is increased to achieve a UGF of 12 Hz this is why the low-frequency content of the ESD signal is reduced and the high-freq content is increased. In principle it should be possible to apply the ALS DIFF feedback to both the ESD and UIM stages right at the beginning to avoid this transient getting applied to the ESD. Note that each ESD signal has an offset +180000 for ETMX and -160000 for ETMY. These are 20-bit DACs so that’s out of a DAC range of +/- 524288. In each case the bias (not shown) is at maximum and of the opposite sign of the signal offset (so -524000 for ETMX). The combination of bias and signal offset sort of maximizes the force available. The force applied by the ESD is: Force = alpha*(V_bias - V_signal)^2 where alpha is a coefficient that is determined by the electrode geometry and is of order 1e-11 N/V^2. The bias and signal channels are all going through the high-voltage ES driver which has a gain of 40. The conversion from DAC counts to voltage applied to the ESD electrodes is: 7.63e-4 V/count. Using these factors I calculate the force range used during acquisition: 1. Including the transient between -19m and -18m. Max force : Signal = 240000 cnt -> 183 V Fmax/alpha = (583 V)^2 = 3.4e5 V^2 Min force: Signal = 60000 cnt -> 46 V Fmin/alpha = (446 V)^2 = 2e5 V^2 Force range = alpha * 1.4e5 V^2 2. Omitting the transient (since it could be mitigated). Max force : Signal = 220000 cnt -> 168 V Fmax/alpha = (568 V)^2 = 3.23e5 V^2 Min force: Signal = 149000 cnt -> 114 V Fmin/alpha = (514 V)^2 = 2.64e5 V^2 Force range = alpha * 5.9e4 V^2 These numbers can be compared to the force range available which is: alpha*(800 V)^2 = alpha*6.4e5 V^2 (In fact the outputs don’t go all the way to the +/-400 V rails so the range is probably ~10% smaller). So including the transient the acquisition uses about 22% of the full range while after the transient it uses about 10% of the full range. Currently for the BHQS (the suspension for the 100 kg test mass) we're considering a test mass and reaction mass size that would provide an ESD range when normalized by the mass of about 60% of the current range (keeping the gap between the test mass and reaction mass at 5 mm). So although this is a smaller (force/mass) than we have now it should be quite sufficient for lock acquisition.,"{'term': 'L1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",74466,peter.fritschel@ligo.org

We have been analyzing loud glitches and their correlation with ERM PDs (alog 72968 ). The results so far are as follows: Correlation with ERM PDs: Over 70% of loud glitches (with SNR>300) are correlated with spikes in the ERM PDs Independence of X and Y Arms: The correlation occurs either with the X arm or the Y arm but not both simultaneously. This suggests that the events are independent (alog 73024 ) Analysis of Individual PDs: At least three PDs show a significant correlation in over 80% of cases. This conclusion holds true for both arms as the analysis was done separately for the X and Y arms (alog 73447 ) Dominance of Bottom PD (PD3): In 60.2% of cases the bottom PD (PD3) has the largest SNR in the X arm. Similarly in 68% of cases PD3 has the largest SNR in the Y arm. The reason for this behavior is still unclear. Since all the analyses point toward the hypothesis of dust particles scattering light near the ERM we calculated the dust size required to scatter light onto the PDs based on its distance. For this we used the Fraunhofer approximation with scattering at an scattering angle θ = 0. We analyzed two specific scenarios: (i) when there is a weak signal (0.1 count) in a PD during a loud glitch and (ii) when there is a strong signal (10 counts) in a PD during a loud glitch. Figures 1 and 2 show the results for cases (i) and (ii) respectively. They show that particles measuring 10–50 microns located approximately 0.2–4 meters in front of the ETMs can cause signals in the AERM PDs. We are also investigating the statistics of the strength of the signals in AERM PDs. Parameters Used for the Analysis: Beam Power = 275kW Beam radius = 6.2cm PD radius = 2.5mm (ref. G2200606-v1 ) Power in the PD = NumberOfCounts*(7.6e-8 W/cts) (ref. alog 66636 ) Laser Wavelenght = 1064nm Mirror transmissivity: 5ppm (ref.

Our observations so far indicate that the comb is only visible in Corner Station channels. Details: The following is a list of the observations we have made regarding this line: - We checked for the 11.11 Hz comb across all Monitor and Magnetometer channels listed in the Fscan configuration using daily (241120) and weekly (241113) plots. - The 11.11 Hz peak strong with high coherence is visible in all CS MAG channels particularly in LVEA_INPUTOPTICS and LVEA_OUTPUTOPTICS: - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_EBAY_SUSRACK_X_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_EBAY_SUSRACK_Y_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_EBAY_SUSRACK_Z_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_EBAY_ISCRACK_X_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_EBAY_ISCRACK_Y_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_EBAY_ISCRACK_Z_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_VERTEX_X_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_VERTEX_Y_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_VERTEX_Z_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_INPUTOPTICS_X_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_INPUTOPTICS_Y_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_INPUTOPTICS_Z_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_OUTPUTOPTICS_X_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_OUTPUTOPTICS_Y_DQ: strong peak - L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_OUTPUTOPTICS_Z_DQ: strong peak - The 22.22 Hz and 33.33 Hz peaks also appear in most CS MAG channels but lack coherence. - Among PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_VERTEX channels only the X channel exhibits high coherence. - The peaks are also prominent in L1_PEM-FCES_MAG_VEA_FLOOR X and Y channels but show no coherence with DARM. - High coherence for the 11.11 Hz peak is also seen in the following Monitor channels: - L1_OMC-PZT1_MON_AC_OUT_DQ (and not in PZT2) - L1_PEM-CS_AMON_BEAMTUBE_40X_DQ - L1_PEM-CS_AMON_BEAMTUBE_40Y_DQ - L1_PEM-CS_VMON_ITMX_ESDPOWER18_DQ (weak) - L1_PEM-CS_VMON_ITMY_ESDPOWER18_DQ (weak) - The peak is not observed in EX or EY channels. - The peak is not observed in MAINSMON channels. - Using Tsft = 900 s and 12h of data we have also checked the additional channels which are voltage monitors in the corner station. The following VMON channels exhibit the 11.11 Hz peak and show high coherence with DARM (L1:CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ): - L1_PEM-CS_ADC_4_15_OUT_DQ (VMON on orange power supply on PSL-R1 in LVEA) - L1_PEM-CS_ADC_4_16_OUT_DQ (VMON on 18V supply on ISC-C1) - L1_PEM-CS_ADC_4_17_OUT_DQ (VMON on 18V supply on ISC-C4) - L1_PEM-CS_ADC_4_18_OUT_DQ (VMON on 12V supply on ISC-C4) - L1_PEM-CS_ADC_4_27_OUT_DQ (VMON on 18V HAM16 SEI rack) - All additional VMON channels in the Corner Station except L1_PEM-CS_ADC_4_28_OUT_DQ (VMON on HAM23 SEI rack) exhibit the peak. It is most pronounced in L1_PEM-CS_ADC_4_27_OUT_DQ. However the 22.222 Hz and 33.333 Hz peaks are not visible in these channels. - We have also been moving additional channels L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_26_OUT_DQ and L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_19_OUT_DQ to monitor different power supplies in order to search for a possible source. - First change: - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_19_OUT_DQ (VMON on 18 V TCS AOS-C1): peak not found. - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_26_OUT_DQ (VMON on 24 V HAM16 SEI rack): peak found. - Second change: - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_19_OUT_DQ (VMON on 24 V HAM23 SEI rack): peak not found - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_26_OUT_DQ (VMON on lower 24 V HAM16 SEI rack): peak not found - Third change: - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_19_OUT_DQ (VMON on lower 24 V HAM23 SEI rack): peak not found - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_26_OUT_DQ (VMON 24 V HAM46 SEI rack): peak found - Fourth change: - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_19_OUT_DQ (VMON on 18 V HAM45 SEI rack): peak found - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_26_OUT_DQ (VMON on lower 24 V HAM45 SEI rack): peak not found - Fifth change: - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_19_OUT_DQ (VMON on 18 V BSC 1 SEI rack): peak found - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_26_OUT_DQ (VMON on 24 V BSC 1 SEI rack): peak not found - Sixth change: - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_19_OUT_DQ (VMON on 18 V BSC 2 SEI rack): peak found - L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_26_OUT_DQ (VMON on lower 24 V BSC 1 SEI rack): peak not found Attaching to this alog some plots in order to illustrate the investigation and how the peak appears in some channels. - A diagram of the VMON checks done in the electronics room searching for the comb. - AMPPSD and Coherence plots of L1_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_INPUTOPTICS_Y_DQ (6.1 pT factor per ADC count above 10 Hz) showing the strong peak with week of data with Tsft 900s. - AMPPSD plot of L1_PEM-CS_ADC_4_27_OUT_DQ (VMON on 18V HAM16 SEI rack) showing the peak in 12h of data with Tsft 900s. - AMPPSD and Coherence plots of L1_OMC-PZT1_MON_AC_OUT_DQ with one day of data and Tsft 900s also showing the peak.

I suspect the culprit for the sqz degradation here is the phase noise so I decided to reduce our nlg temporarily by reducing opo green trans target value from 0.14 mW to 0.12 mW. Based on the recent nlg measurement this should correspond to an nlg decrease from 19.32 to 12.3. Attached is a squeezing vs nlg plot for 23% loss and 10:5:45 mrad phase noise (based on the most recent quantum noise budget in alog 73225 our losses were ~23% and phase noise 10-15 mrad). I assumed the losses are about the same since the high frequency squeezing we usually have is about the same as the time of the quantum noise budget measurements. The curves are calculated the same way as 72135 using the following formulas [E. Oelker et al. Optica 3 682-685 (2016)] and the code is attached .

All three nlg formulas using the unique combinations of size 2 of amplified deamplified and unamplified seed powers: nlg_ad = ((1 + sqrt(amplified/deamplified))/2) ^ 2 nlg_au = amplified/unamplified nlg_ud = (2 - sqrt(unamplified/deamplified)) ^ -2 Nonlinear interaction length is defined as x = 1 - 1 / sqrt(NLG) = sqrt (P/P_th) and from this calculation we find the P_th to be 0.235 mW.

To start I attempted to touch up alignment into the PMC remotely using the picomotors right before it with the ISS off but I wasn't able to get much of any improvement so I turned the ISS back on and made my way out to the enclosure. Once there I started with a power budget of the FSS path using the 3W-capable Ophir stick head: FSS In: 280.4 mW AOM In: 274.0 mW AOM Out (single-pass): 180.3 mW SP Diffraction Efficiency: 65.8% AOM Out (double-pass): 130.2 mW DP Diffraction Efficiency: 72.2% EOM Out: 129.2 mW The largest (and least surprising) area of power loss I noticed was in the AOM diffraction efficiencies so I started there. I adjusted the AOM stage itself mostly in pitch to improve the single-pass and M21 to improve the double-pass. I also checked that the beam was passing nicely through the FSS EOM (it was no adjustment needed here). The final power budget: FSS In: 280.4 mW AOM In: 274.0 mW AOM Out (single-pass): 195.9 mW SP Diffraction Efficiency: 71.4% AOM Out (double-pass): 139.5 mW DP Diffraction Efficiency: 71.2% EOM Out: 138.6 mW Having made good improvements I proceeded to adjust M23 and M47 the picomotor-controlled mirrors before the RefCav to align the beam back onto the alignment iris at the input of the RefCav. That done I then instructed the FSS autolocker to lock the RefCav. As seen before and noted most explicitly in alog81780 the autolocker could briefly grab the TEM00 mode but then lose it. I lowered the autolocker's State 2 delay (which determines how long to wait before turning on the temperature control loop after finding resonance) from 1.0 seconds to 0.5 and the autolocker was immediately successful. I've accepted this shorter delay time in SDF screenshot attached. The TPD was reporting a signal of 0.515 V with the RefCav locked so I used the pictomotors to improve alignment finishing with a TPD signal of 0.830 V . Seeing the beam spot on the RefCav REFL camera was now more than half out of view I rotated the camera in its mount slightly to center the image. I then unlocked the FSS and used M25 to tweak up the alignment onto the RFPD improving the voltage when using a multimeter from 0.370 V to 1.139 V then locked the FSS again to get an RFPD voltage of 0.213 V. This gives a visibility of the RefCav of 81.3% . I wrapped up in the enclosure turned the environmental controls back to science mode and returned to the control room. After about an hour while maintenance activities were finishing I turned the ISS back on currently diffracting around 3.3%.

When TJ and I were testing out the code for the function that generates the INCREASE/DECREASE BIAS states for SUS_PI we had decided on leaving the line in that sets the bias ramp time to 30 for going from a bias offset of -9 back to the nominal bias of -4.9. We thought it would be fine because the ramp time would get reverted when we lost lock but we forgot about the part where we have to go back into Observing after the PI gets damped at the higher bias (oops). At least it was me who had to intervene so I can suffer the consequences of my mistakes! I changed that line in the code( attachment ) so that when we are going from the higher bias to the nominal lower bias the ramp time is the nominal 120 seconds.

44041,H1 ISC - Calibrated Angle to Length Coupling from HARD loops,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81917,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 19 Dec 2024 17:36:08 -0800","This alog follows up LHO:81769 where I calibrated the ASC drives to test mass motion for all eight arm ASC control loops. Now I have taken the noise budget injections that we run to measure the ASC coupling to DARM and used that to calibrate an angle-to-length coupling function in mm/rad. I have only done this for the HARD loops because the SOFT loops do not couple very strongly to DARM (notable exception to CSOFT P which I will follow up on). The noise budget code uses an excess power projection to DARM but instead I chose to measure the linear transfer function. The coherence is just ok so I think a good follow up is to remeasure the coupling again and drive a bit harder/average longer (these are 60 second measurements). This plot shows the noise budget injection into calibrated DARM/ASC PUM drive [m/Nm] transfer function and the coherence of the measurement. I followed a similar calibration procedure to my previous alog: Go from ""H1:ASC-[DOF]_[P/Y]_OUT_DQ"" to Nm of PUM torque using G1100968 I made sure that I corrected by an erroneous factor of two that I found previously Some of these injections were done after the ETMX DAC change. However Daniel noted this alog for me 80023 so the calibration for the ASC should not change significantly. transform this N*m PUM drive to radians of test mass motion using the PUM-TST state space suspension model transfer function which is calibrated into real units (radian/Nm) I did all of this in python so I used Kevin's exported quad state space model found here: T2300299 I used the damped model which applies the ETMX top mass damping filters Multiply by 1e3 to convert to mm/rad I did not apply the drive matrix here so the calibration is into ETM motion only (factor of +/-1) whereas the calibration into ITM motion would have an additional +/- 0.74 (+/- 0.72 for yaw) applied. HARD Pitch Angle to Length coupling plot HARD Yaw Angle to Length coupling plot Overall the best-measured DOF here is CHARD Y. In both CHARD Y and DHARD Y there seem to be two clear coupling regions: one fairly flat region above 20 Hz in CHARD Y and above 30 Hz in DHARD Y reaching between 20-30 mm/rad. Below there is a steep coupling. This is reminiscient of the coupling that Gabriele Louis and I measured back in March and tried to mitigate with A2L and WFS offset. We found that we could reduce the flatter coupling in DHARD Y by adjusting the A2L gain and the steeper coupling by applying a small offset in AS WFS A yaw DC. We are currently not running with that WFS offset. The yaw coupling suggests that we have some sort of miscentering on both the REFL and AS WFS which causes a steep low frequency coupling which is less sensitive to beam centering on the test mass (as shown by the A2L tests) meanwhile the flat coupling is sensitive to beam miscentering on the test mass which is expected (see e.g. T0900511 ). The pitch coupling has the worst coherence here but the coupling is certainly not flat. It appears to be rising with about f^4 at high frequency. I have a hard time understanding what could cause that. There is also possibly a similar steep coupling at low frequency like the yaw coupling but the coherence is so poor it's hard to see. Assuming that I have my calibration factors correct here (please don't assume this! check my work!) this suggests that the beam miscentering is higher than 1 mm everywhere and possibly up to 30 mm on the ETMs (remember this would be ~25% lower on the ITMs). This seems very large so I'm hoping that there is another errant factor of two or something somewhere.

44050,H1 GRD - SUS_PI guardian now increases ETMY ESD bias to help damp PI24,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81909,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:51:04 -0800",Since we've been having issues with PI24 ringing up lately we decided to change the SUS_PI guardian code to increase the bias offset on ETMY L3 LOCK. That bias offset value is normally -4.9 and we noticed that when damping PI24 we typically start hitting our damping limit when PI24 RMSMON exceeds a value of 10. I have turned the PI_DAMPING state into a generator function so it can now make two different states PI_DAMPING and EXTREME_PI_DAMPING. When in PI_DAMPING pi24 will be damped with our normal bias until we reach an RMSMON average value of 20. Once that happens the guardian will jump to a state called INCREASE_BIAS (what it does is self-explanatory) and then goes into XTREME_PI_DAMPING where it continues damping and changing phase as needed until we are back under an RMSMON value of 4( pi24 script logic ). Once we are good the guardian will take us through DECREASE_BIAS (guess what that does) and then back into PI_DAMPING( node graph states list ). Because the nominal state for Observing is PI_DAMPING when we move into one of these other states we will be taken out of Observing ( tagging OPS ). Once we are back in PI_DAMPING we will automatically go back into Observing as long as we are in AUTOMATIC. Occasionally we do get small quick ringups that go up above 20 that are capable of being damped by regular damping and just changing the phase - ndscope1 (versus the slower ringups that cannot - ndscope2 ) so with these script changes when these happen we will be taken out of Observing as the SUS_PI guardian jumps to up the bias and damp harder. These don't happen very often so we are okay for now but a future to-do is to edit the script to keep it from increasing the bias at least until it's tried all phase changes.

Today I re-ran the sqz/h1/scripts/SCAN_PSAMS.py script with SQZ_MANAGER guardian paused (so it's not forcing the ADF servo on). The script worked as expected (setup by turning off ADF servo and increasing SQZ ASC gain to speed up then changed ZM PSAMS waited 120s for ASC to coverage turned off ASC scanned sqz angle and saved data and then repeated) and took ~3m30 per step. The results are attached ( heatmap scans ) but didn't show an obvious direction to move in. Maybe the steps were too small but are already larger than those use at LLO LLO#72749 : 0.3V vs 0.1V per step. Our initial ZM4/5 PSAMs values were 5.6V -1.1V and looking at the attached data we took them to 5.2V -1.5V. We then decided ther range looked better when the PSAMs were higher to went to 6.0V -0.4Vthis seemed to gain improve the range ~5MPc we checked by going back to 5.2V -1.5V and the range again dropped main change appears to be in orange BAND_2 OMC BLRMs which is 20-34Hz the places with glitches in OAF BLRMS are noisy times from Robert's injections. Then went further in this direction to 6.5V 0.0V this didn't help the range so we are staying at 6.0V -0.4V sdf's attached. This seemed to be a repeat-able change that gave us a few MPc's in range!

It appears that measurement is limited to dark noise of the diode above 40Hz. The ITMX_CO2_ISS_IN_AC channel dark noise is actually above the level when the laser is on this doesn't make sense to me. Is there anything strange happening in models or chassis? No. The filters in the DC _OUT channels include a CountstoVolts gain(0.000610352) and UndoGain gain(0.00196078) which is 1/510 from the PD electronics D1201111 as expected The AC _OUT channel includes a CountstoVolts gain(0.000610352) and de-whiten zpk([20] [0.01] 0.011322 ""n""). There is nothing else in the h1hsccs model. Looking at the TCS block diagram E1100892 the ISS PD outputs go though the TCS ISS and Interface Chassis D1300649 ( D1300015 shows there nothing happening to the signals inside this chassis) before going to the ADC. So the model should see the signals as if they were coming straight from the PD DB9 output + counts to volts gain. Does DC value of 7e-3 V make sense? Yes. In CIT#389 saw saw -1V (DCMON so gain of 255) for 60mW of laser power (can jump ~by a factor of 2 dependent on wavelength/polarization/how the laser is feeling). From this expect 1mV from diode (before electronics gain) is 15mW of laser power. So that the DC value measured of 7e-3 V would be around 100mW of power on the PD (within a factor of 2 is 50mW to 200mW). This makes sense as we would expect around 250mW on the ISS PD (50W out of laser x 99/1 BS x 50/50 BS). Does Dark noise value make sense: Unsure. In CIT#541 Gabriele shows DC dark noise values of 4e-7 /rHz this is straight out of the diode (DCMON so x gain of 255) so the comparable value to our _OUT channels would be 1.5e-9 /rHz. This is a factor of 3 different from the 5e-9/rHz dark value we measure at LHO on the DC OUT. Debatable math: The power noise of the diode is 1e-8 W/rHz (from Keita's computations attached to CIT#549 ). So the RIN should be noise-limited to 1e-8 W/rHz / 0.250W = 4e-8 /rHz. We are measuring down to 5e-9/rHz on the DC channel which is a factor of 10 lower than expected possible ","{'term': 'H1 TCS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",81868,camilla.compton@ligo.org

Because of the way LHO changed their readouts for the OMC digging into the simulink model will reveal the PI is reading in only the first 32kHz band for the RMS calculations You simply have no aliasing down of the full band to utilise it in the way we do and it will never see 80kHz PI.

They have moved so that the central frequency is the same as the spikes around 10.4kHz this excites the PI's more. In the first plot we see that since November and the start of December the center of the lower HOM peak has drifted down in frequency to be underneath the 10.kHz PI modes : compare black (now) to red and brown. I tried to check more times to see exactly when this change happened in the 4th attached plot but this is tricky as the location and shape of the HOM depends on how warm the IFO is (i.e. was it DOWN a logn time before locking as in ref 7: Cold IFO). It sees like the change started 6th/7th Dec and was done by 10th Dec. In the second plot we see what happened in September when we increased the ETMY Ring Heater (as we repeated today 81891 ) both HOM peaks moved up in frequency which is the direction we want. Maybe an unrelated point is that since the start of October the circulating arm power has drifted down ~4kW (~1%) from 389 to 285kW when thermalized plot attached. It's hard to know what's caused this the IM4 TRANS drifted ~2% but was misaligned so would see alignment shifts 81735 the POP also drifted ~1% before it was recentered 81329 .

I examined drive strength during the 10kHz PI damping demonstration of the PSL ISS injection path from March [ aLog 70464 ]. Here is an ndscope showing that during the PI damping we were injecting about +/- 40 counts and the AOM drive readback is not really seeing any input. The readback displayed actually has a 500Hz LP but the signal is also invisible in the INMON. Notably during this particular PI we came quite close to lockloss because it took us quite a while to figure out the correct damping settings so you can consider this close to the extreme maximum required driving range. I set about calibrating counts out of the PSL-ISS_TRANSFER2_INJ output to the voltage sent to the AOM from the ""To AOM"" output of [ D1001985 ]. With the help of Josh in EE I measured the response of that box with GAIN inputs as they are in the front end right now. The other notable piece of electronics in the path is the AI chassis [ D070081 ] I effectively modelled as a 3rd order 10kHz Butterworth LP which you might imagine might cause issues for 80kHz injections. There are past injections done through PSL-ISS_TRANSFER2_INJ with as much as 100k counts which I used to peg my overall DC gain with for any components in the path that might be adding gain since 100k counts was roughly visible as 0.01V on the AOM drive. Here is the TF between 5kHz and 100kHz which encompasses D1001985 and D070081 and gain pegged to the aforemented rough readback response. The 40 counts needed to damp the 10kHz PI would have used no more than 1e-6 V of the AOM and indeed would not be readily visible in the AOM readback. There is also the response of the IMC [ aLog 8196 ] which projects the drive at 80kHz will see about 10x suppression relative to the 10kHz injection for real input into the IFO. Therefore to inject the same signal strength out to 80kHz with current AI chassis we'd need to drive 1e-5 V at the AOM and be driving +/-40k counts at the DAC (which I presume is 16bit with a max of +/-131k counts out) which I declare as feasible without even altering the AI chassis. The alterations needed are: the l1psl0 machine will need Dolphin inputs from l1susprocpi and the ideally PSL ISS model will need to run at 65kHz (currently runs 32kHz) to reduce the number of times the signal will need to be imaged up.

During this time the POP9I -> SRCL matrix element was changed from 4 to 1 to minimize the signal. Following the adjustment the PRCL noise coupling seemed to increased in the [20 40] Hz band while decreasing below it. Conversely the DARM response increased below 20 Hz. 10-20 Hz Band Injections: To investigate the increased DARM response PRCL/MICH/SRCL injections were performed in the [10 20] Hz band. The LSC noise couplings showed that PRCL is the dominate signal at lower frequencies SRCL at higher and MICH in-between.

Specifically we aligned the cross marks on the holes in the blade adjuster baseplate with the cross marks on the surface of the top plate. We also ensured the proper alignment of the blades within the blade guard adjuster assemblies. This process included the installation of the blade wire clamp and the blade wire jaw onto the HDS blades. The blades were paired based on the deflection measurement results obtained at LLO . These results can be found in the HDS Blade Deflection Measurements spreadsheet which also details the assignment of each blade to its corresponding suspension. As previously mentioned in alog 73497 the magnet/flag assemblies still need to be installed in the intermediate mass assembly D2000176-v5 . We have most of the parts for the magnet/flag assemblies cleaned and ready in the lab.

Fil just finished the work reconnecting the ITM ESDs and connected the HAM6 high voltage relays to the BSC3 interlocks(something like that - see attached ). After he did this we tested out the port protection but it failed due to the fast shutter not being open. It seems like the fast shutter usually reopens when we are going through PRMI/MICH states so that might have been why it was still closed from our last lockloss but it doesn't completely make sense because earlier before Corey ran the test the shutter had opened on its own while we sat in IDLE. I opened the shutter medm and manually opened the shutter and reran the test. It failed again and said it was due to the fast shutter not being able to reopen even though it had correctly closed and reopened it. I toggled the shutter closed and back open and this time the test ran and came back with OK so it seems like we are good to go to high power. Jenne called and had me check that we had ESD outputs on ITMX which we did so it looks like everything is good to go. When at CHECK_AS_SHUTTERS we did have the LOCKLOSS_SHUTTTER_CHECK alert that we needed to manually check the shutter so I ran the test script on the AS port protection screen again just to make sure and then INIT'ed that guardian.

Fil came in to take the BSC3 vacuum gauge to take the FAILED HAM6 vacuum gauge's place for the HAM6 interlock. This would pull the BSC3 gauge from the interlock it was used for: ITM ESDs---it was thought the ITM ESDs were NOT used. Returned to locking but then it was later brought up that the ITM ESD interlock is indeed needed for TRANSITION FROM ETMX. So we were on hold again. Ultimately it was decided to use the BSC3 vacuum gauge for BOTH the (1) HAM6 & (2) BSC3's ITMx ESD interlocks . Fil came in (2nd time driving out to the site today!) to make this change in the afternoon. The hope is we are now back to a the state before the HAM6 gauge/interlock crashed last night and Oli can return with locking. Winds are lower than yesterday BUT microseism is still high.

We are trying to instead use ETMY. Sheila had started work on modifying our usual guardian states to allow us to use the L3 on ETMY. That was in progress when we decided to try the prewritten (but not tested in while) 'lownoise esd etmy' states. We tried using the 'lownoise esd etmy' state but lost lock when it was doing the L3 Lock L 5 second ramp over to using ETMY. Yesterday's lockloss (at least the one around 27 Dec 2024 02:03:00 UTC) was as Corey said successful getting off of ETMX and then failed at swapping back to the low voltage version of ETMX. Today's lockloss had a ringup of about 161 Hz. Richard called to check in and said that it shouldn't be too hard to tee off (or something) that interlock cable so that it can be used for both ITM ESDs and also the HAM6 high voltages. Richard is planning to talk to Fil about the feasibility of this. Since our current plan is to see if we can go back to our nominal locking sequence I have copied over Sheila's temporary guardian changes (attached here also) and done an SVN revert to the version of ISC_LOCK.py that RyanS had checked in just before the winter holidays. The only diffs between that version and the version in the userapps directory were related to today's temporary changes. Corey has reloaded the guardian. Richard checked with Fil and Fil is on the way to make the change so we can go back to using our usual locking sequence.

Gerardo went out to check to see if it was dead. He phoned Fil and they did a power cycle of the gauge to see if this would improve the situation but it did not. After this H1 was taken to IDLE for the night (OWL shift cancelled). (Should have taken Observatory Mode to CORRECTIVE MAINTENANCE at this point but only remembered to do this this morning.) Work Permit 12260 generated. Fil arrived on-site around 9amPT (17utc). This Morning's Summary of Fil's Work : The HAM6 Interlock (for operations of the Fast Shutter + PZT) is now Using the BSC3 Interlock (or VAC gauge from BSC3 since it was decided to BYPASS the HAM6 VAC gauge which failed last night [alog 82005 ]). This means that the BSC3 Interlock is no longer being used for the ITM ESDs (which sounds like it's fine because Jenne/Fil said we don't use the ESDs for the ITMs). Fil noted that he confirmed that the Fast Shutter Chassis in the LVEA is OPERATIONAL. Fil then left the site after giving me this summary. As far as a test of this new HAM6 Interlock configuration I intentionally ran a test of the AS Port Protection system (sitemap/SYS/ AS Port Protection....this was my first time doing this). After clicking the RUN (test) button after a few seconds received an ""OK"" for the (1) Test & (2) Fault. After this test and the signed-off Work Permit we are OK to GO for High Power locking .

ISC_library.intrix.load() Commenting Out Line 2670 from ISC_Lock allowed me to stay locked in CARM_TO_REFL seems stable. For some reason loading this matrix seems to be unlocking the IFO. After that test that seemed to confirm my suspicion that loading the matrix unlocks the IFO. I had to unlock H1 and try again.... undo my changes.

Modes 3 and 6 are not turned on by the Guardian so were not rung up. I logged in from home and damped those modes. The default settings worked for modes 3 and 6. For mode 5 I used FM6 and FM10 and positive gain (2) and that was able to damp the mode. Mode 4 was more difficult to find after a lot of trials I found that FM1 FM4 and FM10 with positive gain (3) damped the mode slowly.While damping I edited the 1st order violin mode Guardian settings file so that none of the ITMY damping turns on automatically but since the IFO was already in OBSERVE I was not able to load the file. So the next time the IFO goes down please press the load button on the 1st order violin mode Guardian screen.Once the ITMY modes were damped I turned all ITMY damping off and I set the filters for each mode back to default. These modes are funny during cold weather and should not be left unattended they can shift phase and ring up very quickly. So to be safe if they are damped it is probably best to turn them off.SUS,"{'term': 'LLO OpsInfo', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",74609,marc.lormand@ligo.org

I wasn't able to find a filter that would reduce the amplitude of some typical glitches and not adversely affect the phase of DARM at the UGF. The idea was to add a low pass at the output of the L3 drive but it doesn't seem like this will work. I got 3 seconds of ESD drive data for one of the locklosses which had several glitches shortly before the lockloss. I then looked at how the time series for those ESD glitches changed when I added various lowpasses using lsim in matlab. First attached bode plot shows 2 filters red trace (filter2) is a way too aggressive filter blue (filter1) is something that would probably allow DARM to stay stable but only maybe help a little. Second plot is a timeseries showing the effects of the 2 filters on one of the glitches in the data I looked at. Yellow is the drive sent to one of the esd quadrants red is the glitch after applying the unstable filter2 from the first plot blue is with the less aggressive filter1. Even with the unstable filter the magnitude of the glitch isn't really reduced a ton. The phase margin at ~80hz for DARM is about 30 deg the blue filter reduces this by about 6 degrees. Sheila and I have talked about other approaches to make the IFO more robust to these glitches we'll take a look at that next week. ,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",82103,jim.warner@ligo.org

The main message is that we have a decent model of the quantum noise from October (see this and this plot ) can get a fairly independent constraint on homodyne angle and SRC detunings from these squeezer data sets without the filter cavity and some loose estimates for arm power based on squeezer losses. There is a discrepancy between the model and the data in the traces taken near anti-squeezing without the filter cavity that is interesting and I haven't tried to model mode mismatches yet. Outline of how this model is made: start with an assumption about arm power (365kW). Later we can check how this model changes with arm power changed. use noise budget estimate of technical noise at 1-2 kHz measured ASD and assumption about arm power to fit IFO readout efficenecy (82% here compare to known readout losses from google sheet ((1-0.005)*(1-0.00072)*(1-0.015)*(1-0.0096)*(1-0.036)*(1-0.02)= 91.6% expected from OFI 1 pass OM1 OM3 OMC QPD pick off OMC throughput DCPD QE). This implies 10.4% unknown readout losses including IFO to OMC mode mismatch but this depends on the arm power we start with. use the best sqz and anti-sqz (either with or without filter cavity) subtracting noise budget estimate of technical noise at kHz to estimate total squeezer efficiency (72%) and nonlinear gain (14.8). Set the squeezer injection losses so that the total squeezer efficiency is injection losses * IFO readout losses. This gives us 12.1% injection losses compared to 8.2% known injection losses from the google sheet (1-0.015)*(1-0.01)**3*(1-0.01)*(1-0.01)*(1-0.01)*(1-0.01) for OPO 3 SFI passes FC WFS pick off ZMs OFI sqz injection and SRC losses) this gives us 4.25% unknown injection losses . A mode mismatch could cause a different readout loss for the IFO beam than for the squeezer so this assingment of losses could be incorrect if there is a large mode mismatch between the IFO and the OMC. The code fits the squeezing angle for anti-squeezing and squeezing traces to either maximize or minimize quantum noise. For the other squeezing angles (mid squeezing +/-10 from sqz or a sqz) it uses a fit. This fit starts with an estimate of the non-quantum noise made by subtracting the measure DARM asd without squeezing from the quantum noise model without squeezing from 2055 Hz to 2300Hz and adds that to a quantum noise model to fit the squeezing angle. The procedure up to this point should force all the models to match the measurements at 2kHz but not at mid or low frequencies. The first two attachments show data from mid October ( 80664 ) separated into two different plots (one with mid squeezing one with +/-10 degrees from sqz and a sqz) to make it easier to read. We can look at the mid and low frequencies to help us constrain the model for homodyne angle SRC detuning and maybe mode matching and FC parameters. With the filter cavity the traces that are +/- 10 degrees from squeezing and anti-squeezing don't provide much information we can probably skip these in future data sets but the ones +/-10 degrees from anti-squeezing without the filter cavity are interesting. Arm power: We can get some constraints on arm power by assuming that all of our unknown loss is injection loss or all readout loss this gives us a range of 327kW-381kW with a homodyne angle of 10.8 degrees and no SRC detuning. Attached are plots made for the high and lower power models by clicking back and forth you can see that the lowest powers seem to disagree with the low frequency data implying that some of our unknown losses truly are readout losses but this isn't a very precise way to estimate arm power. SRC detuning: Without the filter cavity the mid squeezing traces are most clearly sensitive to SRC detuning shown in this attachment where the SRC detuning of 0.057 degrees is clearly too large. You can flip through these 5 SRC plots which suggests that our SRC detuning at the time of these measurements was between 0 and -0.057 degrees (I'll leave it at -0.029 degrees or -1mrad in the model) . Homodyne angle: In 80747 we noticed that anti-squeezing without the filter cavity is very sensitive to the homodyne angle and that we've been using the wrong sign for our modeling in O4. Here are plots that reaffirm that the negative homodyne angle is wrong with mid squeezing (as we did in 80747) and with squeezing angle +/-10degrees from squeezing and anti-squeezing which also clearly shows the problem for those traces near anti-squeezing. It's also nice to notice that the mid sqz traces aren't especially sensitive to homodyne angle in the mid frequency range taht we were using to set the SRC detuning so this data set without the filter cavity can give us fairly independent constraints on SRC detuning and homodyne angle. Here is a plot of the homodyne angle of 10.7 degrees (based on 71913 ) without the squeezing traces so that it's easier to see what's happening. There is a large discrepancy between the model and FDAS -10 degrees from 30-55Hz and there is also a smaller discrepancy for FDAS+10 degrees in this frequency range. This discrepancy can be redcued a bit by making the homodyne angle larger but that doesn't seem to be a good model of the data so this discrepancy is probably due to something we aren't modeling correctly here. Filter cavity detuning: We have used -33Hz as the filter cavity detuning but data from mid squeezing with the filter cavity suggests that the detuning in this data set closer to 27 Hz. Here is a series of plots to show how mid sqz is sensitive to FC detuning. The last two plots are with the final model paramters it is a reasonably good description of the data with the main discrepancy remaining in the anti-squeezing without the filter cavity. The scripts parameters and data used to make these plots is in quantumnoisebudgeting commit 92f7e965. The quantum noise paramters used are here.

Today the SHG output was particular low so I adjusted the input pointing as well as lowered the temperature to 35.0C (from 35.5C). This gave us about 10% more green power but still not enough! I then further increased the green power by adjusting the waveplate in front of the cube. The rejected power (H1:SQZ-SHG_REJECTED_DC_POWERMON) is currently showing 1.8mW down from around 4.7mW when I started. There is a little bit further to go but we may have to realigning the green fiber coupler on the table.

Since we were out of Observing (and I had already gotten a workspace ready to work on the Squeezer) I wanted to try a ""simple"" Squeezer check (basically what Oli did with taking the Manager to DOWN and going back to FDS. I thought I was close to FDS because all of the sub-nodes went to NOMINAL states and then I believe the Manager would get to FDS but then go to NO SQUEEZING.....Then I realized all their NOMINAL states were set for NO SQUEEZING! So I worked on transitioning all 8-nodes Nominal states for SQUEEZING to work on squeezing but the issue I ran into was that the OPO_LR node had trouble getting to LOCKED_CLF_DUAL due to "" USERMSG 0: No pump ISS means injecting bad squeezing. Going DOWN. "" --->This sounds like yet another different SQZ issue. I did not have issues with the SQZ_FC as far as I could tell (also did not get to see the ""leap second"" issue RyanC noted last night). At this point I was stumped but got a mattermost from Sheila saying she could help in a bit. So I switched all SQZ node Nominal states for NO Squeezing to get more Observing in the mean time. SIDE NOTE: The buisiness for transitioning SQZ Nominal States is not quick or trivial (atleast for my slow self). While transitioning nodes for Observing WITH Squeezing I ran into a LOADING error for the OPO_LR node. Eventually found that it was a typo in the wiki (for editing all the nodes I copied the state from the wiki into the node python files. I discovered the wiki had a typo [or the state had a slightly different name int he past]. For OPO_LR the wiki said to make the Nominal -> ""LOCK_CLF_DUAL"". Eventually figured out from the log that this name was wrong it is ""LOCKED_CLS_DUAL"". At any rate I updated wiki.

After a couple minutes could see that the MANAGER & LO_LR nodes were cycling and not getting anywhere. Wiki First At this point I opened the Troubleshooting SQZ wiki's ""Can't Get To FREQ_DEP_SQZ"" section . From this I took MANAGER to NO SQUEEZING and then opened up all the SQZ Nodes. At this point I notice the OPO_LR node which had been green is actually also cycling (but not as fast as the MANAGER & LO_LR. And OPO_LR was also showing a User Message BUT it displayed too quick that I had to take a screenshot really quick to catch it. This node would hang out at the NOMINAL state (LOCKED CLF DUAL) drop out from this display a message(s) for 1sec and then return to nominal state....all within a minute or so. There were actually 2 messages they were to the best I could see (also attached): pump fiber rej power in ham7 high nominal 35e-3 align fiber pol on sqzt0 Disabling pump iss after 10 lockloss counter. Going to through LOCKED CLF_DUAL_NO_ISS to turn on agai At this point I started diving into medms for anything related to the shy messages above. ""pump fiber rej power"" gave me the most info for where to look but at this point I also wanted to do an alog search. Then Alog Search I searched OPO_LR where I focused on an alog from (1) RyanS which referenced a Tony alog and (2) RyanC . These three alogs narrowed my focus and had me looking at: HAM7 Fiber Rejected Power signal SQZT0 waveplate The Rejected power has been trending for the last month+ up to a max value around 3.0 (where it starts from about 0.03). I wasn't totally sure I had the scenario right so at this point I reached out to Daniel (main contact for SQZ on the Call List). Phoning Daniel For Help After giving a summary the best I could Daniel logged in and started looking. Some of the main points he mentioned: Fiber polarization Did not have enough green power Running out of range Crystal may be degrading Need more Green power! With all that saidm he was able to get the LO_LR node to its nominal state but he mentioned we could also fix the Fiber Rejected Power (atleast until the new year or about a week!). So he started to work on this. And this ended up being what was done by RyanS in his alog. See attached for image showing which waveplate/picomotor he adjusted on SQZT0 along with the HAM7 Fiber Rejected Power signal he watched & reduced. See attached for zoom in of the rejected power signal adjusment he made.

Given that we see two different height shelves that might line up with different microseismic frequencies I also did a higher frequency line in all four ISIs and HEPIs. Huyen had gone around and injected 0.2 Hz on all ISIs so I did 0.32 Hz for the higher microseism peak we sometimes see.

We went only SQZT0 and Sheila adjusted the alignment into the OPO pump fiber with the OPO unlocked bringing the the OPO REFL DC power from 1.7 to 1.9mW.

Sheila and I have started looking at those again post-OFI replacement. Just attaching the plot of power at the anti-symmetric port (ie. into HAM 6) vs. power after the OMC as measured by the DCPDs. The plot is found in /ligo/gitcommon/labutils/darm_offset_step/figures/ and is also on the last page of the pdf Elenna linked above. From this plot we can see that the relationship between the power into HAM 6 (P_AS) is related to the power at the output DCPDs as follows. P_AS = 1.220*P_DCPD + 656.818 mW Where the second term is light that will be rejected by the OMC + that which gets through the OMC but is insensitive to DARM length changes. The throughput between the anti-symmetric port and the DCPDs is 1/1.22 = 0.820. So that means 18% of the TM00 light that we want at the DCPDs is lost through HAM 6.

For the most part we are hands off on the hardware of the Fiber Puller--the alignment should rarely need to be changed for many fiber pulls and there is definitely no need to touch any of the mechanics of the machine. Our main interface with the machine is to load in a Fiber Stock possibly make small adjustments of the upper translation stage and that's about it for the machine. The rest of the handling is via the Labview program laser controller and switches which are outside of the Fiber Puller enclosure. The RESET state issue is worth noting because there had been minimal changes to the system from the afternoon before. The switches which control positions of the upper & lower moving stages had not been touched. Fiber Puller eventually resulted in a correct RESET state but it was after several other ""dry"" pulls (and Labview restarts/checks). The CO2 lasers for the Fiber Puller have some variability in laser power (which we see by the camera videos) and this is normal. Yesterday was notable only because the laser power was very noticeably low. The previous 100W laser (which was a bit older...manufactured in 2010) started to have symptoms of low power in 2021-22 which ultimately led to us decommissioning it and swapping it for the newer 200W laser (manufactured in 2018). Only noting the low-power observation as a data point for possible early end of life symptoms for it. ","{'term': 'X1 SUS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",82200,corey.gray@ligo.org

The CONTROLMON was at the bottom of it's range trying to inject this level of light hence the OPO locking issues plot. In the past we've got back to Observing by following 70050 and lowering the OPO trans set point. But as we haven't maxed out the amount of power in the SHG to OPO path yet we tuned this up with H1:SYS-MOTION_C_PICO_I motor 2 instead. A temporary fix if OPO is having issues and the H1:SQZ-OPO_ISS_CONTROLMON is too low can still be following 70050 . It's surprising that the amount of pump light has increased this quickly and quicker than after the last spot move plot but our OPO refl is still low compared to before meaning that the new crystal spot still has lower losses than the last. We might need to realigned the SHG pump fiber to increase the amount of light we can inject. We can work on improving Guardian log messages. ,"{'term': 'LHO General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",82196,camilla.compton@ligo.org

44392,X1 SUS - Possible Laser Oddities for the LIGO SUS Fiber Puller,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=82189,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 16:21:05 -0800","For reference here is a link with a summary of somewhat recent status for the LIGO SUS Fiber Puller: alog # 80406 Fiber pulling was on a bit of a hiatus with a busy Fall/Winter of Ops Shifts and travel. This week returned to the Fiber Puller lab to pull as many fibers as possible (have some free days this/next week). Thought I would note today's work because of some odd behavior. Yesterday ended up spending most of the time making new Fiber Stock (we were down to 2 and about 12 more were made). Also packaged up Fiber Cartridge hardware returned from LLO and stored here to get re-Class-B-ed. Ended the day yesterday (Jan7) pulling 2025's first fiber: S2500002 . This fiber was totally fine and no issues. Today I did some more lab clean-up but then around lunch I worked on pulling another fiber. Issue with RESET Position The first odd occurrence was with the Fiber Puller/Labview app. When I RESET the system to take a fresh new Fiber Stock the Fiber Puller/Labview moved the Upper & Lower Stages to a spot where the Upper Stage/Fiber Cartridge Bracket was too ""high"" wrt the Fixed Lower Bracket---so I was not able to install a new Fiber Stock. Closing the Labview App and a couple of ""dry pulls"" later I was FINALLY! able to get the system to the correct RESET position. (not sure what was the issue here!) Laser Power Looks Low Now that the Fiber Stock was set to be POLISHED & PULLED I worked on getting the Fiber Stock Aligned (this is a step unique to our set up here at LHO). As I put CO2 beam on the Fiber Stock the first thing I noticed was very dim light on the stock (as seen via both cameras of the Fiber Puller). This was at a laser power of 55.5% (of the 200W ""2018-new"" laser installed for the Fiber Puller last summer). The alignment should not have changed for the system. I wondered if there were issues with the laser settings. I notice I had the laser controller at the ""ANV"" setting---it should be ""MANUAL"". But nothing improved the laser power. Miraculously the laser power (as seen with the cameras) returned to what I saw yesterday for S2500002 so I figured it was a glitch and then moved on to a POLISH but within a few minutes and being mindful of the laser power on the stock on the cameras once again the laser spot became dim. But I did nothing and just let the POLISH finish (about 15min). Fearing there was power-related issue I decided to run the Pull (takes less than a minute) but at a higher power (75% vs 65% which had been the norm the last few months). S2500003 pulled fine and passed. I thought we were good but when I set up for S2500004 I noticed more low and variable laser power. I worked on this fiber later in the afternoon after lunch. This one started with power which looked good to me (qualitatively) so I continued with set-up. But in a case of déjà vu the laser power noticeably dipped in power as seen via the cameras. For this fiber I decided to continue but since S2500003 had a ""low-ish"" violin fundamental freq (~498Hz) I figured I would return to a power of 65% for the Pull (hoping the laser power was hot enough for the pull (and not cool enough to cause the fiber to break during the pull---something which happened with our old and dying 100W laser we replaced in 2024). Pulled the fiber and it all looked fine profiled the fiber and then ran an analysis on the fiber: it FAILED. This is fine. Fibers fail. Since Aug we have pulled 29 fibers and this was the 5th FAIL we have had. This is where I ended the day but I'm logging this work only for some early suspicions with the laser. Stay Tuned For More!

As per previous experiences I went all the way up to -10V (which is attenuated by 0.28/100 in the CM board) but could not get past the true maxima of the transmission (i.e. ""the other side of the slope""). Also the IN1 gain seemed to have an effect on the transmission when the offset was constant i.e. the higher the gain the smaller the transmission. We know that the error signal (in volts) is not drastically smaller at EY than EX.

I enabled the IN2 and made sure that OUT2 is connected to IN1 (1st attachment). With this setting H1:LSC-[XY]_EXTRA_AI_2/H1:ALS-[XY]_REFL_ERR_OUT_DQ is 40dB smaller than the OLTF see the circuit diagram of the CM board ( D040180 especially page 5) and an overview ( D1002416/005). It turns out that the PDH OLTF (2nd attachment note that there's a factor of 100 in the denominator so you have to add 40dB) is about 10dB smaller in ALSY with the nominal setting (red) than ALSX (black dashed) despite that H1:ALS-Y_REFL_LOCK_LOCKEDGAIN (6dB) is 2dB larger than H1:ALS-X_REFL_LOCK_LOCKEDGAIN (4dB). So there's a total of 12dB gain difference somewhere upstream of the common mode board. That shouldn't be such a big deal once it's locked but it could be problematic for acquisition as H1:ALS-Y_REFL_LOCK_ACQUIREGAIN was -20dB while H1:ALS-X_REFL_LOCK_ACQUIREGAIN was and is -6dB. In other words the electronics gain is 14dB smaller for Y than X and the sensing gain upstream of the common mode board is 12dB smaller for Y. It's 26dB difference in total. I wanted to adjust the demod phase in Y but was distracted by something else so I just increased the gain setting for Y: H1:ALS-Y_REFL_LOCK_ACQUIREGAIN is -12 (originally -20) H1:ALS-Y_REFL_LOCK_LOCKEDGAIN is 10 (was 6). For LOCKEDGAIN I tried 14dB and it started dropping lock for unknown reasons 12dB was OK (brown trace) but I just didn't want to get close to 14dB. I'm pretty sure ACQ gain could be increased further but -12dB is the gain I tested first and it locked quickly and I didn't have time.

Last done in 76040 . Want to get a homodyne measurement in our new OPO crystal spot location 82134 would plan to then repeat this a few months later to see any difference. Aligned the homodyne but ran out of time before taking any data. May try to repeat on Thursday during commissioning. Sheila offloaded the IFO ASC and edited the guardian code for clearing the ASC so that it now includes clearing the integrators that we moved into the ZMs. Turned up SEED injected power from 0.7mW to 72mW to match the power from the LO (0.544mW on HDA and B). We later turned the LO power down with the pico HWP to match the SEED power. Jennie adjusted the LO beam with SEED beam blocked to improve the subtraction: Checked we were centered on PDA/B using the steering mirrors downstream of the HD BS and then measured the HD DIFF spectrum. Adjusted BS re centered on HD PDs and re-checked if DIFF spectrum shot noise had improved. Sheila and Jennie aligned the SEED beam onto the LO beam. We expected to be able to see fringing on HD A/B at this point but couldn't tried adjusting the alignment with ZM4 didn't help. It turned out tat the fringing was there clear when using an oscilloscope just unclear on ndscope. Sheila further tuned the SEED alignment to minimize fringing. We measured peaks at 1.85V bottom of fringes at 29mV with 2mV dark noise giving visibility of 97.1% . Then went back to the control room and measured NLG like normal (OPO to LOCKED SEED NLG) NLG = 10.3 . Sheila turned down the SEED beam back to 0.7mW. Then could start to take HD SQZ measurements Using SQZ_MANAGER to SQZ READY HD (takes LO to LOCKED HD) and OPO to LOCKED_CLF_DUAL. We needed to increase SHG power from 10mW to ~16mW to allow 80uW on OPO Trans. Plot attached: Dark noise was the same as original plot LO shot noise (ref10) With NLG 10.3 ASQZ was 13.8dB (ref2) this seems similar to last measurements. We planned to take ASQZ/SQZ data at different NLG's however I was having some issues with the OPO GRD unlocking and ran out of time.

This state hadn't been edited since we moved the ASC integrators to the suspension lock filters so when Vicky and Oli tried it the ASC wasn't really reset making it more difficult to recover from that situation.

My thought was that the suspensions are moving too much to catch and then it would run through the DOWN state after failing to hold it moving the suspensions again. During initial alignment today this happened to me so I waited in down for a bit and then tried to lock. It locked straight away possibly confirming my suspicions. From this I bumped up a timer in Prep_For_SRY in the ALIGN_IFO node to allow SRM to settle a bit more before trying to acquire. Hopefully this will help with the SRY locking issues we've been having but I'll keep an eye on it.

KisselBack in July 2024 ( LHO:78956 LHO:78960 LHO:78975 ) I'd installed some infrastructure in the h1iopomc0 front-end model that picks off the 4x copies of the 2x OMC DCPDs directly at the ADC input sends them through a matrix H1:OMC-ADC_INMTRX_$m_$n and pipes the matrix output into test filter banks called H1:OMC-DCPD_A1 H1:OMC-DCPD_B1 H1:OMC-DCPD_A2 H1:OMC-DCPD_B2 As shown in the above mentioned aLOGs these pick-offs are completely independent of the interferometer the matrix output only goes to these four filter banks and the filtered output is terminated in the front-end code. As such there is no impact on the detector performance noise or calibration if and when the parameters of these pick-off paths are changed. However - a lot of the noise investigations we'd like to do with these paths are the most interesting while the detector is in nominal low noise the state we're in most often for observing - because this front-end is running at 524 kHz - storing these extra test-only filtered output channels to frames is too taxing on the data storage system and - even *looking* at more than 3 channels at a time live is taxing on the front-end's given 1/(2^19 [Hz]) = 1.9 [usec] clock cycle turn-around time.This makes the usual method of testing and changing parameters during an observing run -- ""just change something during a lock-loss during commissioning times or during maintenance then look at the data in the past"" -- intractable.So all this being said in order to increase the amount of live time we have to commission and iterate the tests done with this path I've unmonitored all the EPICs records associated with these pick offs' input matrix and filters. 52 channels total and the explicit list of unmonitored channels is attached as screenshots.Details:The h1iopomc0 model only has one SDF file in /opt/rtcds/userapps/release/cds/h1/burtfiles/h1iopomc0/ safe.snap The target area's safe and OBSERVE .snap files that the front-end uses are both soft links to this file /opt/rtcds/lho/h1/target/h1iopomc0/h1iopomc0epics/burt/ OBSERVE.snap -> /opt/rtcds/userapps/release/cds/h1/burtfiles/h1iopomc0/safe.snap safe.snap -> /opt/rtcds/userapps/release/cds/h1/burtfiles/h1iopomc0/safe.snap So.

I started to test things at 17:00 UTC but ran into a collision with Jim's measurements. During the first attempt I was able to determine that the shutter closing will cause the PCALX_STAT guardian to go to a FAULT [37] State after 60 Seconds. It then cycles between waiting [4] and Nominal_PCAL[10] and Fault mutiple times per second until the fault is resolved. I have remedied this issue. After Jim finished his work I was able to continue testing the guardian using a few other buttons. Potential PCAL Failure modes: Things I've tested: If the channel: H1:CAL-PCALX_OSC_SUM_ON gets turned off then the PCAL_STAT Gaurdian alarms because it is checking for this . This channel is also being monitored via SDF. H1:CAL-INJ_END_SW channel being switched from X to Y does not trigger a fault but this is being Monitored via SDF. H1:CAL-INJ_MASTER_SW channel is also monitored via SDF. OFS Loop Open check worked well by checking to see if this H1:CAL-PCALX_OPTICALFOLLOWERSERVOENABLE channel is set correctly and checking the H1:CAL-PCALX_OFS_PD_OUT16 voltage against a known threshold. Guardian worked well. TXPD H1:CAL-PCALX_TX_PD_WATTS_OUTMON and or RXPD H1:CAL-PCALX_RX_PD_WATTS_OUTMON could have some fault in their signals. the Guardian worked well for this as well. H1:CAL-PCALX_SWEPT_SINE_ON could be turned off. This channel is currently not being monitored. potential solution is to just monitor it via SDF.

44439,H1 ISC - Correcting cumulative range estimation,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81291,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Mon, 06 Jan 2025 16:16:53 -0800","D. Davis E. Capote O. Patane There was a discussion recently in the Detchar tools channel about how to interpret the cumulative range plots generated on the summary pages such as today's cumulative range plot . Specifically it seems incorrect that we could accumulate 30% of our range below 30 Hz. Derek has pointed out that this is so misleading because the calculation of cumulative range in this manner is actually performed somewhat incorrectly. In short range can be thought as analogous to SNR which is a quantity that must be added in quadrature. Therefore the order matters when calculating a cumulative range i.e. the range acquired from 10-20 Hz then 10-30 Hz 10-40 Hz etc. Therefore the total cumulative range number as in the one we think about all the time (160 Mpc for example) is correct but determining the range over a subset of the band (such as 10-30 Hz) needs to be done more carefully so it is not misleading. Once we started discussing this I pointed out that this means that the way we compare ranges is also misleading as in when we run our DARM integral comparison scripts we are subtracting the cumulative range of two different DARM PSDs but we subtract it in amplitude (Mpc) and not in quadrature (Mpc^2). Derek has created an improved way to calculate cumulative range which they have coined to be the ""cumulative normalized range"". To get right to the point: it is better to normalize the cumulative range squared by the total range. This is an example plot showing how these two differ. This plot shows that for a given DARM PSD the cumulative normalized range better estimates the sensitivity gained over a particular range of frequency. The low frequency portion is still very important (this results from the f^(-7/3) dependence in the range calculation) but indeed we gain very little sensitivity between 10-20 Hz for example. You can also see that when using the normalized method the curve where you integrate up in frequency and the curve where you integrate down in frequency intersect at about 50% of the range which is what you would expect. In equation form this image attachment defines the total cumulative range and this image attachment shows our defintion of the normalized cumulative range. In order to more sensibly compare two sensitivities by frequency we have also derived a way to calculate the cumulative normalized range difference. The derivation is slightly more complicated but the result is that you subtract the two cumulative normalized quantities and then normalize by the sum of the two ranges. This image attachment shows the equation form of this. To make sense of why this method is better than the method we use now you can imagine that we have two PSDs one with 100 Mpc of range and one that is exactly the same except that between 10-20 Hz there is an additional gain of 20 Mpc such that the total range is now 120 Mpc. If you compare these two bizarre PSDs you would expect that the cumulative range difference between the two from 10-20 Hz is 20 Mpc and then zero thereafter. This is an example plot showing how the cumulative range difference would appear using the method where you subtract the two cumulative ranges and then the method where you apply this normalized range method. The normalized range calculation behaves as expected while the method that straightforwardly subtracts the two cumulative ranges overshoots the range gain from 10-20 Hz and then misleadingly indicates the range is decreasing above 20 Hz to make up for it. There is a lot of information to grasp here and Derek and I will be posting a document to the DCC soon with a fuller explanation and full derivations. Oli has taken the time to implement these new methods in our DARM comparison scripts and they will follow up here with more information about that.

We wanted to go through and verify what the physical d4 value aka the physical location of the prism-clamp breakoff point is in our latest set of measurements we took at the end of October. We wanted to verify this just because when we were messing around with d4 back in early 2024 ( 75947 76071 ) we never checked any measurements where we changed around d4 with the stage2 parameter correctly on meaning that those d4 comparisons all plotted changes in the effective d's instead of the physical d's. I've plotted a few parameter sets where the stage2 parameter is on so we can more properly compare them. I've plotted: the current default parameter set which has d4 = FDR = 0.5mm as well as having d1 = FDR - 2.5mm this parameter set had been decided by us to be the new default a while ago variations on the FDR parameter set with d4 being the FDR d4 value shifted by +/- 0.5 1.0 or 1.5mm. For these parameter sets d1 is left as its original FDR value Our most recent measurements from October 31st which was after all the M1 blade heights had been changed Here are the plots . The zoomed L and P plots are the best for seeing the differences between the different parameters. The Oct31 measurement seems to match best somewhere between d4 - 1.0mm and d4 - 0.5mm so the value of d4 that we have in our current set seems to still match pretty well. It is interesting to see though the difference between the dark red and the yellow traces as compared to our latest measurement since the only difference between those two is the d1 value. It looks like somewhere along while messing with the blade heights we also moved away from the d1 = FDR - 2.5mm value and closer to the d1 value given in the FDR.

I ran all the injections with the calibration lines off. The pitch couplings now appear to be very flat which is what we expect. However they are very high (100 mm/rad !!) which seems nearly impossible. The yaw couplings still show a strong frequency dependence below 30 Hz and are flat above and around 30-50 mm/rad still large. Whether or not the overall beam miscentering value is correct this does indicate that there is some funny behavior in yaw only that causes two different alignment coupling responses. Since this is observed in both DHARD and CHARD it could be something common to both (so maybe less likely to be related to the DARM offset light on the AS WFS). I also ran a measurement of the CSOFT P coupling injection plot . I was only able to get good coherence up to 30 Hz but it seems to be fairly flat too CSOFT P coupling .

Last done in 80451 followed those instructions. Before translating the crystal we reduced the green H1:SQZ-SHG_LAUNCH_DC_POWERMON power from 30mW down to 6mW. After we finished we brought this up to 15mW and still could lock the OPO with 80uW on H1:SQZ-OPO_TRANS_LF_OUTPUT and around 6 on the ISS controlmon. Meaning our losses reduced significantly. We moved from the 3rd spot from the left photo to the 4th spot from the left photo ( 34 x steps of 50 to the right and then 19 x steps of 10 to the right). We have previously used the 2nd 3rd and 5th spots from the left there is 6 spots in total. Measured NLG to be 8.8 (0.0787/0.00892 76542 ). This is lower than what we usually run with 11 to 17 so means that this new spot has less losses but a worse NLG. FDS is the same but ASQZ lower.

An example of BNS range oscillations can be seen at the beginning of Jan 1 2025 ( link ). in this a-log we looked at the camera signals for the four test masses looking for any correlations. The attached plot shows the camera signals (minute-trend of mean) during a few hours on Jan 01 2025 along with BNS range. We see some movement of beams especially on ETMY (SUM). The ETMY SUM (and WX) show visible half-hourly oscillations similar to BNS range oscillations. But it shows oscillations even when there is no BNS range osscillations. So it is not clear whether there is any cause and effect scenario here. From the control persepective it is little interesting and maybe one can check whether we can reduce these beam movements. We looked at the camera signals before ( alog 73336 ) during another time when there were BNS range oscillations. In that a-log we looked the 16 Hz camera signals so they were a bit noisier. Here we look at the mean averaged over a minute which show some variations.

L1 remained in observing mode for the whole day of 12/30/2024 & 12/31/2024. Most of the lock losses were due to earthquakes and some due to L1 being in commissioning. Average BNS range remained between 160-170 Mpc with multiple days having dips due to microseism high winds and ground motion. Microseism remained high throughtout the week with some major EQs causing lock losses. Wind and ground motion also remained on the high causing noises in the PEMs. Corner and End BSCs contained low frequency high amplitude noise multiple days which could be correlated to environmental factors such as wind and ground motion (See DQ Shift Report for more details). L1:LSC-REFL_A_RF9_Q_ERR_DQ channel appeared in multiple HVETO summaries during the week. Some new channels appeared for multiple days while some channels repeated.

The transmitted power increased from 4.1 to 5.0. I'm hoping this helps improve the FSS locking time (see FRS ticket 32977 ). I also lowered the ISS diffracted power from just above 6% to just below 5%. We had increased this when we were having locklosses from ISS AOM saturations which were ultimately due to a sub-optimal PMC alignment (see alog 74478 ). The PMC alignment has been stable since the re-tuning hence the decision to reduce the ISS diffracted power back. This gives more power out of the PSL and also increases the FSS power (transmitted power is now ~5.2).,"{'term': 'L1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",74729,adam.mullavey@ligo.org

The idea (as I follow it) is that because the 64 kHz channel has different aliasing the noise ought to look different in the two channels if it is aliasing-related. In fact the two channels look similar albeit not identical which looks like evidence against the aliasing hypothesis. However this test may not catch all the places where aliasing could occur so it may not be conclusive. See the associated detchar-request issue for ongoing discussion. The first two plots are from 2023 during time periods which were previously identified as having line contamination around the violin modes ( 71800 79825 ).

Overall bad recovery from maintenance. Here’s what happened in 7 short stories: Late LN2 Fill: NORCO arrived to fill CP8 at 00:34 UTC (16:34 PT) over 3 hours late while we were locking. Jim made EX as robust as possible such that we would survive their truck moving through. This worked though the BRS was all over the place as expected. Due to them driving <5mph as requested they took 20 minutes to arrive at EX then over 1 hr to do the fill and then another 20 minutes to get back. They left site at 02:34 UTC (18:34 PT). After NORCO left I undid Jim’s seismic configuration changes to go back to nominal. Changes made prevented locking: Earlier in the day (before NORCO arrived) we lost lock at state 557/8 TRANSITION_FROM_ETMX. I was told by the DAY operator that if this happened I was to revert Camilla’s changes in alog 82277 with regard to the DARM Boost. Since Camilla and Sheila were in the room when this happened they decided not to do it since it could have just been bad luck. Erik had also made changes regarding ramp times that affect this state. Camilla and Sheila left for the day and then NORCO arrived. While NORCO was filling we lost lock again at state 557 TRANSITION_FROM_ETMX. Camilla told me to revert her changes and Jenne told Erik to revert his. This was done by 1:31 UTC (17:31 PT). Changes reverted prevented locking: We could not lock ALS until Norco left the EX area which happened ALS locked finally at 02:10 UTC (while Norco was en route from EX). Locking then happened automatically until state 500 PREP_DC_READOUT_TRANSITION where for 10 minutes I was getting the error message “OMC not ready”. I then called Camilla who didn’t answer. I then called Erik who was still on site and came to help troubleshoot the issue (since his changes involved resetting OMs - the idea was that maybe this is related which it is likely not). After some fiddling to no avail I called Sheila (the first person on the call list) who walked me through the OMC troubleshooting process. Troubleshooting with Sheila and Erik: I informed Sheila that the error was that the OMC TF was not letting guardian continue. We did a manual OMC scan while waiting at ASC_QPD_ON to see that there indeed were triplets with 2 sidebands and one carrier with the right magnitude. We let guardian lock it and it did yielding the expected signal magnitude for the DCPD_SUM and PZT2 Monitors. Looking closely at the error Erik realized that it was the phase that was below the threshold (150) and was measuring at 144. Sheila Erik and I then decided to lower the phase threshold to 140. This worked immediately until we also lost lock just as immediately when we transitioned to DARM_TO_DC_READOUT which saturated DCPD EX EY IX and HAM6. This happened at 04:13 UTC (20:42 PT). At 4:49 UTC I reverted the phase changes to OMC_LOCK guardian since clearly something else was awry. “Did you try turning it off and back on?”: After the lockloss and the reversion we went up to lock again preparing to face the same issue DTT template and TF in hand and then… it worked. Perhaps the lockloss from earlier was from transitioning the OMC with whitening to the OMC without whitening (which I did after achieving the full OMC lock during troubleshooting). Now our next hurdle is state 557/558 (TRANSITION_FROM_ETMX). The DARM Boost is actually still on: It turns out that the DARM boost had to be turned off in two places rather than just line 3058 ( alog 82277 ) there was another later boost turn-on at line 3774. Sheila discovered this during troubleshooting at 5:15 UTC. Since we didn’t want to tempt H1 by turning off abruptly we chose to leave it on and see what would happen at 557/558. After some anticipatory sighs it worked! We automatically went all the way to NLN. 05:40 UTC - reached NLN!

44547,H1 ISC - Data in OMC DCPD Test Point Readbacks Limited by Single-Point-Precision above 7kHz when IFO is in Nominal Low Noise (and NOT limited anywhere by ADC Noise),https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=82268,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Tue, 14 Jan 2025 15:34:50 -0800","J. Kissel T. Sanchez E. Goetz L. Dartez *EDIT* This limitation is only pulling out data with test points from the A0/B0 filter outputs due to them being recorded in single precision not double precision. The actual data for all internal calculations is double precisions and in fact for the final calibrated gravitational wave strain is both calculated in and then stored in frames as double precision. Back in July 2024 when I started to characterize the super-16 kHz-Nyquist frequency data off the OMC DCPDs with the live 524 kHz channels. See LHO:78516 for the whole story but we got stalled when we ran into what we believed was some sort of single-precision numerical precision noise limited at the equivalent of 1e12 [A/rtHz] DCPD current or 1e-6 [V/rtHz] ADC voltage.In LHO:78559 we ruled out single-point precision calculation of the ASD when we ran the same DCPD signal through a special version of DTT which uses double-precision to calculate the pwelch algorithm. That version of the data proved that the high frequency limitation is still there and NOT the precision of DTT.In that same data set we also showed that if you ask DTT to remove the mean i.e. large DC component of the signal it also did NOT have any impact on this limit.And it's in removing the mean that we reveal / confirm that it is ""single-point precision"" limit in the test point readbacks . Check out 1st attachment which is the data from LHO:78559 but with no DTT calibration applied . That means the channels are calibrated into the units of whatever they are coming off of the front-end -- in this case milliamps or [mA].The DC value of the test point channel during the time of measurement was ~20 [mA].The front-end computes all its filtering in double precision but the readbacks of the products of those calculations are single-point precision. An IEEE 754 32-bit base-2 floating-point single precision channel has 24 bits of significance (excluding the sign and exponent) to hold the entire frequency dependent content of the time-series that has a DC value of ~20 [mA]. The (front end filtering algorithm?) rounds the 20.43 DC component to the nearest 2^n value i.e. 2^5 = 32 [""mA""]. Eq. 2.2 of Liquid instruments article on quantization noise suggests that the amplitude spectral density of 1 bit spread across the 0 to 2^18 Hz (f_Nyquist) frequency range over which we care is n_{ASDRMS} = sqrt( DELTA^2 / (12 * f_Nyquist) ) = DELTA * sqrt( 1 / 12 * 1/f_Nyquist ) where - DELTA is the minimum step resolution (i.e. the peak value / number of significant bits) - the factor or 1/12 comes from the expectation value of the noise power derived from the integral of the product of instantaneous noise power and the probability that that power is distributed across one specifically the least significant bit (and we use the square root because we want the amplitude not the power) - the factor of 1/f_Nyquist comes from spreading out the (presumably frequency independent ) power over the entire frequency range (and again we use square root because we want the amplitude not the power) In line-by-line math that's [[ 32 [""mA""_DC] peak value * (1/2^24) significant bits in single precision) ]] [[ 1 bit * (1/sqrt(12)) expectation value quantization noise amplitude spread across 1 bit * (1/sqrt(2^18 Hz)) quantization noise spread across 0 to Nyquist frequency range ]] = [ 32 / (2^24) ] * sqrt[ 1 / (12 * 2^18) ] = 1.07539868e-9 [""mA""/rtHz] This number *exactly* the high-frequency asymptote we see. BINGO! The next step was then to create pick-off paths of the ADC channels and high-pass -- i.e. remove the large DC component of the signal -- in the front-end. Importantly this has to be the *first* filter so the DC component is removed before any other calculation is done. We added the infrastructure and installed the filtering ( LHO:78956 LHO:78975 ) but have not come back to the data until today.Today we're finally looking at the front-end OMC DCPD data that's been high-pass filtered with a 5th order 1 Hz high-pass with 40 dB stop-band attenuation and a 1 dB ripple ellip(""HighPass""51401) The odd (5th) order means that DC component is completely suppressed leaving only the remaining frequency-dependent accumulated RMS which is 5.8901e-4 [mA_RMS] to upper limit of the dynamic range and define the precision limit.SIDE QUEST -- Fractional numbers are much less intuitive to ""just round up to the nearest power of 2^n"" so the equivalent of ""converting 20.43 [mA] to 32 [""mA""]"" for 5.8901e-4 is instead a process of Converting 5.8901e-4 to floating point binary # sign exponent fraction 0 01110100 00110100110110111110111 # round up the fraction part 0 01110100 01000000000000000000000 # convert back to decimal 0.00061035156 That takes the quantization limit down to = [ 6.1035156e-4 / (2^24) ] * sqrt[ 1 / (12 * 2^18) ] = 2.05e-14 [""mA""/rtHz] Take a look at 2nd attachment which compares the normal nominal OMC DCPD data to this 1 Hz high passed data. One can see all of the AA filtered data all the way out to the 232 kHz Nyquist frequency because that data only goes as low as 1e-13 [mA].Finally in the last attachment we re-cast this into ADC noise units to show where the data against the trace we'd had as a bench mark before. Note *this* comparison is a false comparison because the digital AA filtering is applied after the ADC noise is added. So -- don't read anything into the fact that the resolved noise goes below the ADC noise -- it's just a guide to the eye and a bench mark to remind folks that the numerical precision limit is *not* ADC noise. In conclusion if we want to investigate the OMC DCPD data above 7 kHz with test points we need to make sure to use a version where the data is high-passed significantly. So now we can actually begin doing that...CAL CDS ISC ","{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",82268,jeffrey.kissel@ligo.org

To check I put some in for P and Y in the FM7 slot and turned them on while coordinating with Jennie. Jennie saw no difference with them on or off so it confirms Jenne D's suspicions.

DartezAs we began to use the new OMC DCPD test infrastructure ( LHO:78956 LHO:78975 ) to pick up where we left off in characterizing the new-to-O4 segregated OMC DCPD 524 kHz low-noise ADC system ( LHO:78516 LHO:78559 ) we found in necessary and fruitful to - shift some of the installed filters around in the A2 and B2 banks (the one's the replicate the reverse-calibration filters that turn the raw ADC counts in mA on the DCPDs the copies of the A0 and B0 ""NewV2A"" and ""NewAW"" -- moved from FM1 and FM2 to FM2 and FM3 like they are in the A1 and B1 banks.)- add the 1 Hz 5th order elliptic high-pass as an option to the A2 and B2 filters in FM1 (like the A1 and B1 banks) and - split out ""divide-by-four"" gain of 1/4 that turns the sum of the four channels into an average from the ""cts2V"" ADC calibrating gain of 40 / 2^18 [V/ct] = 0.00015258789 [V/ct] ~ 0.0001526. The ADC gain in th previous cts2V bank was actually implemented as a typo of the 16 bit ADC calibration divided by 4. The ADC gain should be 40 / 2^16 [V/ct] = 0.000610 3 5156 [V/ct] but was installed as 0.000610 5 ""[V/ct]."" And then the multiplication of the gain of 1/2^2 = 1/4 = gain(0.25) to convert from 16-bit to 18-bit calibration was immediately adjacent to the gain(0.25) for turning the sum into an average. Not so clear.So what was cts2V = gain(0.0006105)*gain(0.25)*gain(0.25) in FM4 is now two separate filter banks 18b_cts2V = gain(0.0001526) sum2avg = gain(0.25) in FM4 and FM5.The new filter banks and arrangement have been committed to the SVN under /opt/rtcds/userapps/release/cds/h1/filterfiles/ H1IOPOMC0.txt rev 30385 Also -- it appears as though the B1 and B2 filter banks didn't have their filters properly *un*monitored when I touched the SDF system last week ( LHO:82155 ).

44568,H1 AOS - Progress on two input arm scattering issues: ITMY CP yawing causes spot on HAM3 ballast mass baffle to move; mystery beam spot comes from ITMX direction,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=82252,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:49:38 -0800",Bright beam spot on HAM3 ballast mass baffle moves with ITMY compensation plate yaw motion We have been looking for the source of the scattering noise that varies with the ITMY compensation plate yaw setting ( 80499 ). I recently searched for beam spots in the HAM3 area that move as CPY is yawed using movies that I took from both the MC2 camera viewport and the PR2 camera viewport near HAM2. Anamaria and I had done some of this before ( 77631 ) but this time I recorded the CP movements on the audio track of the movies for a more precise correlation. And I also modified the movies in iMovie to increase visibility of faint spots. Figure 1 shows that I did find a spot that moved precisely with CPY Yaw settings (link to movie clips: https://youtu.be/FDdNDPoQadU ). The spot appears to be on a ballast mass baffle (see Fig. 1) which is not angled as much as the scraper baffle (which I think the beam is supposed to fall on ( Alena's slides )) and may thus retroreflect more light. Mystery beam spot on HAM3 spool piece comes from ITMX direction not HAM2 direction I had previously misinterpreted the pattern of light on edges and bellows of the HAM3 spool piece as suggesting that the mystery beam spot ( 78192 ) was coming from the HAM2 direction . More recently I found that there was light on the HAM3 side of the MC baffle that had a similar interference pattern and was consistent with being part of the mystery beam spot (Figure 1). The light on the HAM3 side of the baffle was visible when looking through the viewport for the PRM camera at a high angle. Thus the beam is most likely coming from the ITMX direction travelling close to the –Y wall of the beam tube. One possibility is that it actually comes from ITMX either scattered light from ITMX or scattered light from the back side of MC2 reflecting off of ITMX. Figure 3 shows these suggested paths and a picture taken from the point of view of the beamspot on ITMX that shows that there is a clear path to the site of the mystery beam spot. I think that the cartoon shows that it would be worth using a real model to determine if these paths are possible. I checked to see if the beamspot on the eye baffle moved or modulated when I actuated the compensation plates. I made movies as I moved the two compensation plates more than 600 microradions in pitch and yaw but unlike the spot on the ballast mass baffle I did not see any modulation or motion of the spot on the eye baffle.

This is part of the work to understand how to move the beam on PR2 in order top avoid a reflection and subsquent stray beam off the PR2 scraper baffle (as found in alog #77631 by Annamaria and Robert). The P2L gain was close to optimised and has been left at -0.36. The commissioning window ran out before I could finish optimising the Y2L I have left it at -7.00 which gave better A2L decpupling than the previous value. Method: Inject line on PR2 M3 stage pitch at 30Hz using the OSC 9 filter bank in the ADS. sitemap-> ASC -> Dither overview Check the PIT9 filter bank at the bottom of the page is not being used (CLK gain = 0). Set the matrix at the right of the row to have a 1 in the PIT9 to PR2 cell. Check there is a ramp time in the PIT 9 filter bank. Set the frequency to 30 and step the amnplitude to 1 in a couple of steps. Measure a reference for DARM and PRCL. The red and blue traces show the case when injecting into pitch with nominal A2L gains. Set the aevraging to exponential and zoom in on the line. Change gain in HzTS->PR2-> M3 DRIVEALIGN->P2L Do this until the line height relative to the background is minimised allowing time for the ramp and a couple averages each step. One thing to note is that the line height above the background in the PRCL spectrum (LSC-PRCL_OUT_DQ) is much less than the relative height above the background in DARM which suggests that the noise in PRCL is not coupling strongly to DARM. Switch off the line and set the PIT 9 amplitude to 0 counts. Then repeat the above for the YAW 9 oscillator channel in the ADS changing the gain in the Y2L gain filter bank in order to minimise the line height. The reference values for yaw are in the photo linked above with the green line showing DARM (we had gone into NLN cal meas with SRCL FF switched off for Elenna's SRCL tests so that is why DARM shows elevated noise). The orange line is the reference value of PRCL using the nominal Y2L gain. The same amplitude was used in the oscillator for this line but it was much higher above the PRCL background noise than for the pitch degree of freedom.

This measurement works by using the radiation pressure coupling of SRCL to induce differential radiation pressure in the arms which depends on a couple factors one being the arm power. This measurement is made by injecting into the SRCL control signal and measuring the transfer function of of the relative intensity noise on the transmission QPDs of each arm to DARM. Measurement requirements: know the calibration of DARM well (must be CAL DELTA L in this case) turn off the SRCL feedforward Make sure the TMS QPDs are centered ensure high coherence (>0.9) of DARM to TMS QPDs However I once caused a lockloss running Craig's measurement templates so I wanted to be sure that I could drive hard enough to get the required coherence but not break the lock. Last week I ran a couple of test measurements with the SRCL feedforward off and the TMS QPDs as well centered as possible. I have a screenshot of the results below. You can see that the DARM/SRCL coherence is very good but the DARM/TMS QPD coherence is very bad. This is true for the NSUM channels as well as the individual segments. When I tried to drive harder I would get ETMX saturation warnings. The signal appears almost four orders of magnitude above the noise in DARM and about one order of magnitude above the noise in the TMS QPDs. The centering loops we use center onto QPD B of both arms but cause the beam to be off center on QPD A in both arms. However the coherence is equally low on both the A and B QPDs so I don't think the centering is the issue. Craig and I previously tried centering onto the A QPDs but then you become miscentered on B and also cause other problems see 67066 . Today I instead drove single lines using awggui. I was able to achieve >0.9 coherence at three different frequencies without causing any saturations anywhere at about 70 Hz 49 Hz and 34 Hz. Good coherence was observed with both the NSUM channels and the individual segments of the TMS QPDs. I also confirmed that we see the expected differential phase in the signal between the X and Y arm. We were not thermalized today so I plan to rerun this measurement on Thursday using these three points. This should be sufficient information to measure the arm power and also confirm that we observe the predicted 1/f^2 coupling. I can also use the regularly scheduled Thursday calibration measurements to make sure we know the CAL DELTA L calibration. ,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",82248,elenna.capote@ligo.org

I've been looking at the possibility of thermal coupling of localized regions of the lab temperature to the test masses. This was explored a bit previous in these alogs: Environmental to test mass thermal lens coupling: aLOG 73011 Spatial temperature variations in the LVEA: aLOG 69071 To study this I looked at a 72 hour lock from late Decemeber 2024. Over that time the AVTEMP of the LVEA stays within +/-0.1C (+/-0.15F) of the average temperature. However ZONE1 around the 3 BSC chambers (and ITMs) sees a tempreature excursion event from t=56hr to t= 64hr. This indicates that test masses may be be heated during this time which could cause transient thermal lenses (with opposite sign to the transient change in the temperature and some time delay). If we look at the Hartmann sensor data we indeed see negative lenses start to form around t=58hrs. Some Finesse modeling earlier indicated that the 9MHz PRG will be impacted by this. We do see a corresponding change in RF18 signal strength as indicated here. However there is no corresponding change in the range (at least nothing significant). Finally there is some indication from tracking fluctiations in test mass eigenmodes that the test masses are getting warmer (due to increasing eigenmode frequencies). The time delay between the lab temperature change and test mass eigenmode change looks to be about 4 hours. This is more circumstantial. The interplay of time delays here needs to be properly understood. TCS ,"{'term': 'L1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",74834,aidan.brooks@ligo.org

The duty cycle of L1 was 84.3% on average this week. Most of the lock losses were either due to earthquake wind or commissioning. There was one that had no apparent reason. (Earthquake: 17th 21st 22nd.Commisioning: 17th 19th.Unknown cause: 18th.) The range fluctuated between 145 and 175 Mpc throughout the week. Sometimes there was a drop in range mostly due to ground motion such as at 07:30 UTC and 22:00 UTC on 17th Dec 07:00 UTC on 18th Dec 22:00 UTC on 21st Dec and 21:20 UTC on 22nd Dec. There was some low-frequency noise in the h(t) spectrogram on December 19th (from 10 to 30 Hz possibly related to L1:LSC-REFL_A_RF9_Q_ERR_DQ based on Hveto round 1 results) December 21st (from 10 to 50 Hz possibly related to L1:LSC-REFL_A_RF9_Q_ERR_DQ based on Hveto round 1 results) and December 22nd (from 10 to 30 Hz possibly related to wind and L1:LSC-REFL_A_RF9_Q_ERR_DQ based on Hveto round 1 results). There was some periodic low frequency noise present in the BSCs throughout the week. There was low frequency noise (~7-8 Hz) in all the acoustics throughout almost the week. There was also a cluster of noise burst present in the acoustics on 22nd December. Hveto: There were some new channels throughout the week. In general there was a different channel every day. The most frequent channel is L1:LSC-REFL_A_RF9_Q_ERR_DQ which appeared 7 times. Fscan: All the plots have appeared. The line count ranged from about 340 to 510 and all of them were below the threshold. Special events: (1) Lockloss at 05:06 UTC 18th Dec was due to unknown cause and possible noise today might be due to a weather front. (2) The range drop was caused by being out of the observing squeezer at 13:32 21st Dec ( aLog_74596 ). (3) The low frequency (10 - 30 Hz) noise between 19:40 - 24:00 UTC on 22nd Dec might be caused by wind. And there was a cluster of noise (5 -1000 Hz) between 06:10 - 08:15 UTC corelating with drop and improvement in the L1 binary neutron star inspiral range (DMT SenseMon).

I drive from the M1 V excitation point deactivating the bandstop for Bounce/Roll. I read out in the M1_DAMP_V_IN1 M2 OSEMS and the M3 OpLev . Signal was clearest in OpLev Pitch and Yaw. OpLev Pitch some broader response that was skewing both the magnitude and phase response to which the Yaw was less susceptible to. I fit what I saw in the OpLev Yaw response and rotated the phase such that at the approximate peak the phase response would be 90 degreess. Here is the hand fitting (I had difficultly doing automated fitting with complex data). The bounce mode is approximately at 16.797 Hz with a Q of 550 . In line with Masayuki's ringdown measurement [ 58663 ]. In air measurements had this at 180 [ 55677 ]. I'm working on expanding the Band-Stop in the Bound bank in the MICH_L controller to remove broad non-linear response around the band stops of the Bound and Roll mode to improve the quality on injections for MICHFF and ultimately rework and clean up nastyness around the Bounce mode seen in the last figure of [ 74547 ] to get a better overall MICHFF subtraction.

The squeezer was having trouble locking/staying locked in FDS so once we were out of Observing for 8 minutes IFO_NOTIFY went into ALERT_ACTIVE during which it should have called Ryan but maybe it didn't get to because only 20 seconds later it got back to FDS. However it dropped back out a few seconds later and once those 8 minutes had gone by IFO NOTIFY went into ALERT_ACTIVE again and it did call Ryan at 07:21 UTC. When the SQZer got back to FDS for a few seconds two minutes later it again took us back out of ALERT_ACTIVE and then waited the 8 minutes again before going into ALERT_ACTIVE again and sitting in there for 23 minutes while the SQZer tried to relock. During these 23 minutes Ryan did not get called. Then the same thing happened again where the SQZer got to FDS for a few seconds taking us out of ALERT_ACTIVE and resetting that 8 minute timer. This time it stayed in ALERT_ACTIVE for over 4 hours and did not call Ryan until more than 4 hours later. I've attached an ndscope and the IFO_NOTIFY log from last night complete with my commentary. It seems like besides the times where the call did not go out like it was supposed to there might also need to be repeat calls made during times where we sit out of Observing for longer periods of time maybe once per hour or per 30 minutes?

44731,H1 ISC - Evidence for in-band lines caused by aliasing of lines in high-sampled frequency DCPD ADC,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=82329,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Fri, 17 Jan 2025 13:18:27 -0800",E. Goetz J. Kissel L. Dartez Summary: There is evidence that some of the lines found in the gravitational wave band are actually aliased lines from higher frequencies. So far it is unclear exactly how many of the lines in the run-averaged list are due to this problem and if the lines are stationary or if violin ring-ups may induce more lines in band due to aliasing artifacts. Further investigation is needed but this investigation suggests that the current level of anti-aliasing is insufficient to suppress the artifacts at high frequency aliasing into the gravitational wave band. Details: We used the live test-point acquisition of the 524 kHz sampled DCPD data in DTT channel H1:OMC-DCPD_B1_OUT (equivalent to the nominal H1:OMC-DCPD_B0_OUT channel used in loop). This channel had the same 524k-65k and 65k-16k decimation digital AA filtering applied. The time series was exported from DTT and processed by stitching together the time segments into a single time series. Then one can process the time series using the scipy.signal.welch() function of 1) the full 524 kHz sampled data 2) 524 kHz sampled data decimated (no additional AA filtering) by a factor of 32 to get the 16 kHz sampled frequency data 3) 524 kHz sampled data decimated using additional AA filtering by using the scipy.signal.decimate() function which has a built-in anti-aliasing filter.We also plotted in DTT the individual channels against the 16k H1:OMC-DCPD_B_OUT_DQ channel showing that some of the lines are visible in the in-loop DCPD 16 kHz channel but not visible in the test point 524 kHz channels.Figure 1: ASD of raw 524 kHz data (blue) decimated data without any extra anti-aliasing filter applied (orange) and decimated data with additional anti-aliasing filtering (green). Orange peaks are visible above the blue and green traces above ~750 Hz.Figure 2: ASD ratio of the decimated data without anti-aliasing filtering to the raw data showing the noise artifactsFigure 3: Zoom of figure 2 near 758 HzFigure 4: ASD computed from DTT showing DCPD B Ch 1 5 9 13 and and the H1:OMC-DCPD_B_OUT_DQ channel at the same time as the 9 and 13 channels were acquired (limitations of the front end handling of 524 kHz test points to DTT)Figure 5: Zoom of figure 4 near 758 HzWe were also interested in the time-variability of these artifacts and watched the behaviour of H1:OMC-DCPD_B_OUT_DQ and saw amplitude variations on the order of factors of a few and frequency shifts on the order of 0.1 Hz at least for the artifacts observed near 758 Hz.Figures 4 and 5 indicate that there are more artifacts not necessarily directly caused by aliasing perhaps these are non-linearity artifacts? This needs further study.A count of the number of 0.125 Hz frequency bins from 0 to 8192 Hz of the ratio between downsampling without additional anti-aliasing filtering and the raw 524 kHz ASD indicates that ~4900 bins are above a threshold of 1.1 (though most of those bins are above 2 kHz as indicated by figure 2).CAL DetChar ISC ,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",82329,evan.goetz@ligo.org

On the BS suspension the ISC path includes filters that whiten the high frequency ISC signal a limit is applied to that whitened signal then it's dewhitened. Think the filters used for this are a zpk(12001) and it's inverse with a limit of 50000 in the ISC input to the BS. I attempted to look at the impact of doing that on a couple glitches leading up to a lockloss. I got data for the ESD drive from one of the lock losses and used lsim in matlab to model the change in the ESD timeseries. The attached image shows the timeseries for each step of whitening limit and dewhiten compared to the original glitch. It's not a proper model of the DARM loop Sheila and I might talk about doing that I just wanted to see if doing the simplest estimate would blow up before digging deeper into it. Thick blue is the original ESD drive from one of the quadrants Red is the whitened siganl yellow is the whitened signal limited to below the saturation level for the ESD and the thin purple line is the dewhitened final timeseries. The thin line doesn't show crazy behavior and stays below the saturation threshold (2^19*275 which comes from some adjustments made to accomodate the new dac on ETMX). I expect if this worked it would inject some higher frequency junk into this segment but the glitches already do that. The hope is this would reduce the drive from these high frequency saturations and let the IFO ride them out. ,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",82315,jim.warner@ligo.org

44753,L1 ISC - Sideband Modulation Change Test - Powers at ports and buildups,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=74879,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Tue, 21 Jan 2025 11:49:00 -0600",Valera Anamaria In December we did some modulation reduction/increase tests for both 9 and 45 MHz. This allows us to derive more carefully the sideband versus carrier content of various ports particularly the PRGs REFL and AS port. The conclusions are shown as compared to an Optickle model that has perfect modematching for reference. The model is made to match carrier PRG input total power and darm offset. I had a bit of a hard time because it turns out that I had to carefully assess the changes in both sidebands even when only one was changed. The attached table shows the actual powers at each step as well as my assumptions I take as given on input power level and nominal modulation strength. Then at the bottom it shows the way I set up the equation for the fits over the 5 data points for each port separately. I scale 9 and 45 MHz input power from nominal by the POP18 and POP90 fractional changes then I assign the rest of the power to carrier (negative or positive) in order to keep the total input power the same (which it is as seen in the data). I added my data matlab script and the slides that i extracted these pngs from in this ligo drive . NB I scale down the POP A PD power by 8% since it's miscalibrated by that much as previously found . For example when we change the 9 MHz the POP90 also changes and once that is accounted for the AS port content of 9 MHz is higher I verified this by hand. Due to this extra correction it seems to imply that we have much less junk carrier at the AS port than previously thought: 33mW which would be equivalent to about 50ppm contrast defect . I am making some loss assumptions to say that 62mW before OM1 is equivalent to the 50mA DCPD setting but an error there would only change the extra carrier result a few percent at worst. The data also says we have more 45 MHz in the PRC and at REFL which might have thrown off some of the previous analyses and calibrations especially my previous calibration of the PRC sideband power s. I redo here the POP18 and POP90 calibrations (using the NORM channel which is already divided by input power): POP18: 0.0190 W/ct POP90: 0.0270 W/ct For the REFL port we have similar amounts of 9 and 45 MHz. Due to the PRG we expect 0.91W carrier so subtracting that we have ~1.4W/55W which is about 2.5% mode mismatch of input+PRC beam to arms . ,"{'term': 'L1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",74879,anamaria.effler@ligo.org

Since sqz-ifo/omc alignment has been extremely stable since summer 2024 this was flagged as unusual. We couldn't recover our usual squeezing level since then (see plot -5.5 dB at best) so this was worth following. I had a hunch about this being hysteresis in ZM5 alignment so today I reverted the ZM4 & ZM6 alignment in pitch&yaw and just aligned with ZM5. This recovered the squeezing level (see plot ). The recovery supports the notion that big changes (1000s of counts) made with ZM suspensions may cause hysteresis. Comments on SQZ-IFO/OMC alignment state: We are back to the same alignment state on ZM4/ZM6 that we have been using for the last 35 days. As a reminder an exploratory fine alignment scan was run on 2024-12-12 only on yaw. Before we could also run it on pitch we lost lock. The squeezing level was on par with our best level so did not pursue this alignment any further. It may be informative to spend a bit more effort on this in the future. Comments on PSAM state: The PSAM settings have been the same for the last 46 days and the same as the optimized value on August 19th . There was a month long period over November where we operated with different PSAM settings see plot . At that time this clearly improved the squeezing level see plot mentioned in alog 73846 . Later on on December 2nd the PSAM settings were reverted back to the state on August 19th (see plot ) with the reasoning that the PSAM curvatures should change based on the thermal state of the IFO and so we should be able to use the same settings with the same thermal state. This proved to be correct the obtained squeezing level was still ~ our best with the August 19 settings. There are two interesting things to note here: 1. The PSAM optimization on October 31st was soon after IFO being out of lock for a long period of time (19 days during the vent) can also see in plot that PRG was not completely recovered either. 2. Although the PSAM optimization improved the sqz level on October 31st the sqz level doesn't really change with the revertal on December 2nd. This indicates there may be degenerate mode matching (xy axes combined) scenarios across the PSAM coordinates (ZM4 ZM5) although not necessarily with the same ellipticity of the sqz beam.

So today I coaligned GR to IR using FCG M1 pico on HAM7 table. Ideally I hoped I'd be able to optimize green alignment when FC IR is locked but any movement with this pico (even slowest movements and smallest steps) caused OPO to drop lock. So I followed: Freeze FC ASC (GRD state) align GR with the pico. This also dropped FC green out of lock many times so the process took about 30 minutes. Th FCGS refl camera used to have a green ellipse that marked the ""good alignment"" for green lock and a pink circle for IR lock. Now the green ellipse marks the good alignment for both green and IR locks pink is deleted. I expect this will help with the fidelity of the FC GR to FC IR handoff.

44793,L1 INS - DARM signal from dust particle going through arm cavity beam,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=74863,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 16 Jan 2025 13:31:54 -0600",The first attched plot shows a spectrum (as it appears in the control room) and the time series of one of the characteristic DARM glitches that have a rate of about one per few hours which has been invariant withing a factor of 2 since the start of aLIGO (similar glitches were also present in iLIGO). The rate is about the same in L1 and H1. The amplitude varies by several orders of magnitude. The bandwidth varies by a factor of few and goes up to 1 kHz. In the attached example the pulse has the peak value of h~8e-20 and the duration of ~1ms. It was suggested long time ago that the glitches are caused by the dust particles falling from the vacuum envelope. After discussing with the vacuum experts I am considering three sources of dust partticles: arm beam tube (iron oxide) ion pump (titanium oxide) cryopump (H 2 O). I assume that particles are in free fall separating from the walls at the heights 0.6 m 1 m 0.7 m respectively. I solve numerically for the particle temperature and size as it falls through the beam - first melting and eventually evaporting. The frequency cut off for the signals from the evaporated molecules is a few kHz. The forward scattered field is calculated using the formulation from T890025-01: Esc/Earm=4kα/w 2 exp(-2r(t) 2 /w 2 ) where the molecular polarizability α is replaced with that of the dielectric shpere α=d 3 /8(n 2 -1)/(n 2 +2). At 1um the refractive index of H 2 O is 1.33 and TiO/FeO is ~2.3-2.5 depending on exact compound. For the dust size d>1um I interpolated the d 3 with d 2 to get the correct assymptotic dependence for the forward scattering amplitude. This approximation should be good to an order of magnitude (I didn't want to deal with the full Mie expression since the shape of the dust particles is well defined). The r(t) is the position of the particle. The attched plots shows the particle temperature and strain as a function of time and distance from the test mass center for dust size(diameter) d = 1 um and 5 um and the arm power of 300 kW (O4) and 100 kW (O1). The table below gives the max strain and the duration for each case: Arm power (kW) 300 100 Dust size (um) 1 5 1 5 Beam tube Strain (1e-20) 0.55 55 1.5 140 Beam tube Duration (ms) 1.0 1.3 1.1 1.6 Ion pump Strain (1e-20) 0.28 0.78 23 12 Ion pump Duration (ms) 5.4 9.4 16 8.9 Cryo pump Strain (1e-20) 0.0035 0.43 0.0094 1.1 Cryo pump duration (ms) 4.9 6.1 5.5 7.3 We plan to do a test proposed by the vacuum team of closing both the EX/EY ion pump gate valves for a day or so.

44992,H1 SUS - TAKE TWO : Calibration for QUAD/Triple Top Coil Drivers' FASTIMON (assuming Broadband Monitor Board),https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=82771,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:53:17 -0800","J. Kissel Context Recent investigations into how much DC alignment offsets the quad reaction chains ( LHO:82669 ) drove the discovery that the calibration of the current monitor channels aka FASTIMON channels I'd modeled in 2024 ( LHO:77545 ) was wrong. Because the collection of circuits involved have a lot of single-ended to differential conversions along the way and factors of two are easy to get wrong I took the time to measure a QUAD TOP coil driver in the lab with trusty multi-meters and SR785s. Executive Summary For all the work validating the model below -- the corrected model of the FASTIMON channels are correct (and a factor of exactly two different from LHO:77545 ): ----------------- calibration_QTOP [V/A] = 2 * 40.00 [V/A] * (10e3 / 30e3) = 26.667 [V/A] or 0.0267 [V/mA] or 37.5 [mA/V] calibration_QTOP [ct/A] = 2 * 40.00 [V/A] * (10e3 / 30e3) * 1 * (2^16 / 40 [ct/V]) = 4.3691e+04 [ct/A] or 43.691 [ct/mA] or 0.0228 [mA/ct] ----------------- calibration_TTOP [V/A] = 2 * 29.83 [V/A] * (10e3 / 30e3) = 19.887 [V/A] or 0.0199 [V/mA] or 50.285 [mA/V] calibration_TTOP [ct/A] = 2 * 29.83 [V/A] * (10e3 / 30e3) * 1 * (2^16 / 40 [ct/V]) = 3.2582e+04 [ct/A] or 32.582 [ct/mA] or 0.0307 [mA/ct] ----------------- calibration_OTOP [V/A] = 2 * 279.63 [V/A] * (10e3 / 30e3) = 186.42 [V/A] or 0.1864 [V/mA] or 5.3642 [mA/V] calibration_OTOP [ct/A] = 2 * 279.63 [V/A] * (10e3 / 30e3) * 1 * (2^16 / 40 [ct/V]) = 3.0543e+05 [ct/A] or 305.43 [ct/mA] or 0.00327[mA/ct] Review of the Model In the EE shop I pulled the spare TOP driver S1102666 which happens to be yet another ""the only difference is the output impedance"" Transmon flavor of TOP driver D1001650 which has the same output impedance as the QUAD TOP D0902747 . But just because I chose a ""different"" TOP driver gives me the excuse to review the model and why the output impedance matters for the calibration of the current monitor. Recall for these top drivers Z_OUT = (R5+R1) || (R90+R91) = (R5+R1) * (R90+R91) / (R5+R1 + R90+R91) Z_OUT^(QuadTOP) = Z_OUT^(TransmonTOP) = (44 * 440) / (44 + 440) = 40.00 [V/A] Z_OUT^(TripleTOP) = (32 * 440) / (32 + 440) = 29.83 [V/A] Z_OUT^(OMCTOP) = (292 * 6600) / (292 + 6600) = 279.63 [V/A] Which changes the calibration of the coil current monitor because ADC [ct] [ ""R1"" [V_SE] ] 1 [V_DF] 2^16 [ct] ---------------- = [ 2 * Z_OUT [V_DF / A] * ----------- ] * -------- * ----------- Coil Current [A] [ ""R2"" [V_DF] ] 1 [V_SE] 40 [V_DF] where you'll notice *the* difference between the equation here and that in LHO:77545 is the ""conversion"" from the single-ended output of the current monitor which is piped to the positive leg of its external differential output while the negative leg is held at 0V. So the ADC which reads (positive - negative) will just read out a value that's equivalent to the original single-ended voltage. Measurement Setup I first attach diagrams of the measurement setup so that that's no confusion about factors of two from which pins I read out how.(1) (pages 1 and 2 of CoilDriver_FASTIMON_Calibration_Diagrams.pdf ) Validating calibration at DC :: Using the SR785 and an SR785 accessor box to drive a range of DC voltage offsets differentially into the DAC input of the driver I measured the voltage across a dummy OSEM set of resistors -- as a proxy for the coil current -- and the differential output voltage of the FASTIMON and the SLOW RMS I MON. Although we didn't expect it I did this in two configurations to make sure the answer didn't change whether the low-pass switch is ON vs. OFF.(2) (pages 3 thru 5 of CoilDriver_FASTIMON_Calibration_Diagrams.pdf )Validating calibration at AC (~ 1 to 100 Hz). Using a similar setup but now making sure the inputs and outputs are read out truly differentially (making sure all BNC shields are connect to the chassis 0V) I drove a swept-sine excitation through the driver from 0.1 to 1000 Hz in various configurations in order to capture (a) The ""standard"" transconductance measurement Coil Current per DAC input voltage (b) The transfer function we really want which is the per FAST I MON per Coil Current (c) A bonus FAST I MON per DAC input voltage Results The rest of the .pdfs show the results of these set-ups. While mildly interesting they all agree with the model.

This is a Scientific Linux 7 machine this OS is obsolete and updated tzdata packages are not available. As a work around to get psinject running again I hand copied a debian12 version of the /usr/share/zoneinfo/[leapseconds leap-seconds.list] files. At this point monit was able to successfully restart the psinject systemd process. In conversation with Mike Thomas at LLO he had seen this problem several weeks ago and implemented the same solution (hand copy of the leapsecond files). Both sites will schedule an upgrade their hwinj machines to Rocky Linux post O4. Timeline is (all times PST): 07:43 psinject process fails H1 is unlocked 08:41 H1 ready for observe but blocked due to lack of hw-injections 09:34 psinject problem resolved H1 able to transition to observe.

The driving amplitude of the Pcal at 7.68 is about 20% lower than the injections that were being run the week before deliberately done to reduce kicking the Pcal during ramping to reduce broad band coupling into DARM which would affect other measurement frequencies like the L1 which is driving at ~12 Hz at this time.

We initially had a hard time to open the container as the viton gasket ( D1400366 ) was REALLY firmly stuck to the container lid ( D1400367 ) and the container base ( D1400365 ). We put the container on top of small stainless steel cart and used screwdrivers to pry the cover off from the base plate. Even after two corners were freed we could not lift the lid just by hand and we had to continue prying the lid until all four corners were freed. Contamination: After finally removing the lid we found two bases for concern the first is the contamination. There were some class A hardwares (screws/bolts washers one half of the QPD PCB retainer and what turned out to be one of the two adjustment cams for one of the two plate high reflectors) scattered around on the transport container base plate which is supposed to be a class B surface. But the base plate was dirty when we wiped it using pre-soaked wipe. Another half of the QPD PCB retainer was freely lying on the ISS PD base plate ( D1300323 ) which is supposed to be class A surface and it was dirty too. We wiped all parts that were not attached to anything and they were all dirty. We haven't assessed the quality of the diodes nor the plate optics but there's no reason to believe that they are not contaminated. The first two pictures shows the container assembly before and after removing the lid. Note that the second picture shows the class A ""cover"" for the assembly tilted back. It turns that the cover was just put there free to rattle. Connection rods that are supposed to attach the cover to the cage structure were not bolted to the cage. The third picture shows how filthy the container base plate was. It also shows a half of QPD retainer parts that were found there next to a swagelock fitting attached to the base plate.

Jane Glanzer is working on running lasso for some of the recent noisy times including the max as well as mean channels so that may provide additional clues. We still see the ITMX CO2 ISS channel correlated with range. Note on Feb 7th Lasso chooses H1:IOP-OAF_L0_MADC2_EPICS_CH15 which is the same thing as ITMX_CO2_ISS_CTRL2_INMON For the 9th the Rayleigh statistic also clearly shows this issue: summary page for Feb 9th but comparing this to one of our normal days (range just below 160 and stable on Feb 4th ) we also see nonstationarity at these frequencies. So it is possible that we normally have this non stationary noise at a lower level and it is always limiting our sensitivity. Feb st we had an incident where the ISS CO2 channel was correlated with the range screenshot . Feb 1st there was also a remarkable change in the FC length control signal peak to peak which has not shown any correlation with these range drops in the last week and a half but did last may ( 78485 ).

After measuring this we unlocked for unknown reason and so team PR2 moved 6mm towards the centre of PR2 in yaw while unlocked. We estimate we are roughly centred on PR2 now. Today Sheila and I measured the spot coming out of the HAM3 viewport as was done by Robert in this entry. The process is replace the black glass guillotine with lexan guillotine take off the illuminator clip a lens on a stalk to the top of the guillotine and align this with the beam coming out of the viewport. Not all the light is now captured by the lens as the spot is now more a semi-circle of a clipped beam. We moved the power metre behind the lens till we found the max power we could get on the power metre. This was 8mW and the PR3 yaw slider was at around -74 microradians . After we came back to control room the IFO lost lock so it was decided to move towards the centre of PR2 which had been measured by Sheila using an A2L measurement at the start of the commissioning period. Matt tuned down on PR3 yaw in 3 microradian steps to -232.4 microradians. Each step he tuned the 8X picomotor to bring back the DIFF and COMM ALS beatnotes. Every so often it is also neccessary to step up the pitch on PR3 to compensate for the cross-coupling of yaw to pitch. The ndscope image for the moves is here .

I assumed somewhat unrealistically that the temperature jumped by +1F at 11AM and this was uniform across the LVEA. I have been looking at the behavior of IFO signals to changes in environmental temperature and examined those with strong linear responses to the defocus in the test masses. Knowing these linear fits we can try to predict the behavior of these signals when the temperature changes. It's likely that the defocus is inducing these effects but this model is still based upon correlation rather than causation . I've included: Defocus (drops by about 28uD double pass) SQZ DCPD RATIO 4: estimated to rise from -5.7 to -4.6 POPAIR_B_RF18: estimated to rise by about 7.5% REFL_A_LF: estimated to drop from around 9200 to 9000 AS_B_DC_SUM: estimated to rise from about 8200 to 8550 POPAIR_B_RF90: estimated to rise from 2.97E4 to 3.09E4 ISC Non-image files attached to this report LLO_1F_prediction_plots.pdf ,"{'term': 'L1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",75215,aidan.brooks@ligo.org

No channels have been lost. However we encountered an expected issue during this procedure we lost 867 and added a single channel during our first attempt. All the lost channels came from a single file /opt/rtcds/llo/l1/chans/daq/L1EPICS_DAQ.ini This file is automatically generated when Puppet (system admin software) is run on the boot server We only intentionally run Puppet on the boot server during updates as we did on previous Tuesdays ago for the Duotone upgrade. ( https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=75103 ) When Puppet was run the channel file was updated but without explicitly running the CDS EDCU update process the main channel file list edcumaster.txt will all the channel definitions was unchanged. However we did run EDCU update process when adding a channel for today’s update. Initially we lost 867 channels (and added the one channel we intended to add). The lost channels were all frame monitoring channels. Adding a missing field to the Puppet configuration field added back all missing channels and additional added 247 channels as well as the one channel we intended to added. CDS has recently updated channels using the same procedure we performed today. We believe this issue occurs during Puppet runs. https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=74327 https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=74009 We continue to investigate the divergence of the Puppet version-controlled configuration files and how these configurations interact with other Real-Time CDS code repositories.

The repeated points show large discrepancy. Note these measurements were taken shortly after locking (~40 minutes). The point of doing this sweep was to fit the NLG vs squeezing level plot to V_real [dB] to estimate loss and phase noise see example figure 1 for 27 mrad phase noise with varying loss and example figure 2 with 23% loss varying phase noise. Considering the phase rotation and mode matching changing during thermalization this data may require a fit across loss nlg squeezing phase across multiple loss curves if we really want to fit it. I thought 1.5 minutes each would be enough time with 40 minutes after locking (quick recovery after a lock loss) this is on me. I expect well thermalized IFO with slightly longer data sets to give more reliable results. One thing to note here is squeezing level drop roughly above 20 nlg and below 13 nlg. V_real [dB] = 10 * log10 (V_real./V_shot) : squeezing in dB units compared to shot noise V_real = V(phi) *cos(theta_rms)^2 + V(phi+pi/2) *sin(theta_rms)^2 : squeezing in presence of phase noise V = cos(phi)^2 * (1-(4*nu*x)/(1+x)^2) + sin(phi)^2 * (1+(4*nu*x)/(1-x)^2) nu = 1-loss x = 1- (sqrt(nlg))^-1 : normalized nonlinear interaction strength (also x = sqrt(P/Pthreshold)) phi : squeezing angle 0 for squeezing in phase quadrature 90 degrees for squeezing in amplitude quadrature Shot noise is calculated with nlg = 1 (i.e. x = 0): V_shot = cos(phi)^2 + sin(phi)^2 = 1.

Figure 1 presents the comparison. The plots in blue represent the number of glitches in December (used as a reference) while the plots in green correspond to the period when the pumps were isolated (for all three SNR thresholds).

We hadn't revisited the end stations in a while so we also wanted to test how our monument positions had fared over time. Every FARO device move we performed better than 0.1 mm accuracy for multiple positions in each end station so we are happy with our current monuments but might want to add a few more to make measuring in-chamber during the vent easier. The BSC Support tubes are slightly out of their nominal position (~3 mm) relative to the end station monuments. Data for X-End can be found HERE . Data for Y-End can be found HERE . Interestingly the X-End support tubes are more constrained than the Y-End support tubes within their respective BSCs. Joe H said that this shouldn't be unexpected though because the X-End HEPI had to be rotated after it was assembled so it's nice to see FARO noticing the work of the past. ,"{'term': 'L1 SYS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",75189,timothy.ohanlon@ligo.org
45123,L1 SQZ - -6 dB squeezing recovered,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=75184,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Mon, 10 Feb 2025 16:31:14 -0600",About two days ago squeezing level dropped from -5.7 dB to -5.2 dB see attached plot . Over the weekend I tried tweaking the CLF phase and made small changes to OPO temperature to see if the drop is related to the warm weather or crystal degredation but these didn't help. Today I started with optimizing NLG with OPO temperature. This did not improve the squeezing level (see plot ) although the new optimal temperature is notably different. It is worth noting that we are now back to the OPO crystal temperature levels before the cold weather came in and forced us to increase the OPO crystal temperature see alog 74948 see attached plot . So obviously there is some temperature change on HAM7 but this wasn't the culprit for the squeezing drop. Then I ran alignment on ZM5 only on and pitch and yaw. This recovered the squeezing level to ~-5.8 dB comparable to the levels before the drop see plot . (I also ran the same single suspension alignment for ZM4/6 and did not get additional improvement) Since the squeezer alignment to the IFO has been extremely stable since last summer when TCS was turned off this is strange. The only thing that I can think of is the suspect timing with the big earthquake that happened around the same time. In the attached plot about 2 days ago the squeezing level initially degrades to ~ -5.5 dB before the earthquake then after IFO is relocked after the earthquake the level is degraded further to -5.1 dB. It is plausible that the initial drop is within usual temperature/phase drift reasons (which is recoverable by tuning crystal temperature and CLF phase). After this I ran a PSAM scan which recovered -6 dB squeezing see attached plot . The change in the PSAM settings is to compensate for the recent changes in the ITM ring heater settings that the commissioning team have been making Valera and I were expecting this change to be necessary based on our observations over the last few weeks with different ring heater settings. The attached plot shows the change in squeezing level achieved for different ring heater settings with no changes to the PSAM settings until today.

On a couple of the more recent instances of this there was also an MC2 saturation callout right before the lockloss leading me to believe the IMC was having trouble staying locked. The RefCav alignment has been dropping over the past several days (likely due to the change in weather) and has needed an adjustment so thinking that might help the IMC I paused between lock attempts to touch up the RefCav alignment using the picomotor mirrors in the FSS path. I was only able to improve the signal on the TPD from about 630mV to 740mV in the few minutes I spent but I was about at the limit of improvement I think I could get.

The problem was that our temperature control sensors were mounted on the walls and were influenced by the temperature of the walls. As a result the HVAC overheated the LVEA to keep the wall sensors at the same temperature when it was very cold out or over-cooled the LVEA when the sun shown on the walls ( 33320 ). We moved some of the sensors to cable trays by the vacuum enclosure to combat this problem but since the sensors on the cable trays dont provide full coverage we still use many of the wall sensors. Yesterday we took more of the wall sensors out of the control average because we are having some problems in this cold snap with the suspensions lengthening. In addition TJ altered the LVEA temperature figure of merit to focus on the sensors on the cable trays so that we would be alerted to temperature increases at the chambers where previously we were mainly monitoring the temperature at the walls. The figure shows which sensors are now being used (checked boxes). It also shows the new FOM - the first 4 channels are on cable trays near the IFO.

Rick and Keita are unsure how the support rods ( first picture ) were bent during transit and they appear to have bent at the top and deformed the cover piece ( D1300717 ) they were attached to as they came unfixed at the other end and so were just resting on the top of the QPD mount plate (D1300719). They appear to have moved around and scored the surface of this platform. Maybe this happened in transit or storage but it seems like it would have had to be a large force and Rick says the storage containers were packed in form during transit. 1st package: Base piece ( D1101074-v2 S/N 004 ) is double-bagged in my office and I have put in a clean and bake order as this spacer is site specific in height and some of our ISS spares will have a spacer set to the L1 beam height instead so we may need to swap it out. 2nd package: Cover piece D1300717 with the spacing posts attached is not bagged properly as we probably do not want to reuse this and so it is in Keita's office. 3rd package: Array and mirror assembly with PDs still attached was wrapped in foil with dry sealed clean room wipes protecting top optic in periscope then double-bagged. Shown in center left of this image . This will need re-cleaned if we want ot scavenge parts form it. 4th package: All the other parts from assembl y shown in this image ( apart from PD assembly baseplate tool pan and top cover) have been packaged up in foil and double bagged in one package. These will also need recleaned if reused. These last two packages are stored in the cabinet that the spare ISS array units are in situated in the vacuum bake prep area next to the PCal lab.

O4 utilizes the new permanently installed magnetic coils to do broadband injections while O3 was run using the smaller coil which injected frequency combs. Going forward the permanent large coils will allow us to run injections faster and more reproducible. Sitewide plots and text files used to produce this comparison can be found at the following links for each run.

LLO has been moving SQZ-CLF_REFL_RF6_PHASE_PHASEDEG by hand. I am motivated to automate this as much as humanly possible. Two immediately obvious approaches: Write a Guardian adopting the LHO control scheme if it looks like it correlates (probably incorporate ADF control because myself and Adam found it unmaintained: [ 75262 ]) Write a Guardian emulating what we do by hand which runs every few hours or where we ""perceive"" squeezing has degraded. A quick look shows the OMC demod of the ADF tracking the angle and every time we hand correct the Squeezing angle or OPO temperature the observed the SQZ-ADF_OMC_TRANS_SQZ_ANG moved to about 11 degrees (which can be rotated to zero by changing the Demod phase). So we'd need more information for the 'goodness' of the OPO temperature to make this a system that optimises squeezing levels robustly. Towards the end of this last lock (intrrupted by EQ) I was able to get some fraction more squeezing (edit: and associated range improvement) by rotating the squeeze angle to maintain what we see in the ADF demod whilst crudely moving the OPO temperature and observing improvements in CLF RF demod (SQZ-CLF_REFL_RF6_ABS_HP_INMON) but probably more clearly seen as increases in the CLF ISS control signal [ screenshot ].

Trending back we see that the PLL servo that is s'pose to keep it locked at 2050Hz was turned off 16 days ago (on the 29th January at 20:41 UTC) and coincided with an LSC0 crash. Likely this setting isn't saved in the SAFE SDF which is probably how it should be but we should have one of the SQZ guardians turn the servo on. We're planning to implement a guardian servo that uses the ADF to correct the SQZ angle like they have at LHO so we will have that same code turn these things on. For now though I've turned this servo back on (turned on at 20:38:42 UTC). This did drop us out of observe briefly.

Two locklosses during my shift and they both had that weird oscillation in DARM right before the lockloss (see 82847 ). Relocking went okay as long as I ran an initial alignment. First relocking: At the start of the initial alignment during green arms I did get the ALSX issue where it's locked but the WFS won't turn on. I Forced the auto-centering for the WFS and that was all it needed. Once we got back up to NLN we were having issues with the filter cavity losing lock (similar to the issues from the rest of this weekend). It was losing lock at different places in the locking process (FIND_IR GR_VCO_LOCKING TRANSITION_IR_LOCKING etc). I tried just running SQZ_MANAGER through DOWN and back up but that didn't work. I then tried moving FC1&2 a bit to get them back to where they were during our last lock but that also didn't work. I then just tried what Ryan S did yesterday ( 82840 ) - I paused SQZ_MANAGER in LOCK_CLF and adjusted the OPO temp. That worked well and we were then able to lock the filter cavity start squeezing and get back into Observing. Tagging sqz Second relocking: I just made sure to immediately run an initial alignment and there were no issues getting back to NLN and Observing. LOG: 00:06 Lockloss - started an inital alignment - ALSX was locked ( but oscillating weirdly ) around 1 but the WFS wouldn't turn on - the auto-centering was off (we've been seeing this recently sometimes).

To do this I made a histogram plot for all of O4 showing the amount of locklosses we had each day in blue and then over that plotted the number of those locklosses that have ETMX glitches right before the lockloss ( plot ). Basically it looks like it's been with us since the start of O4. There are times where we go a week or maybe almost a whole month without getting locklosses from them but they're still pretty regular and we see them every few days otherwise. In O4b it looks like we saw them very often between end of August to early October and then saw less of them in December but it's also hard to quantify because we had less locklosses in December but that could've been either due to more time locked or due to more time when the detector was down (same with November - that was when we had all the NPRO stuff). I also have this plot as a pdf and here's the link to my lockloss tool in case anyone wants to peruse the early O4 ETM glitch locklosses . Also keep in mind that a few ETMX glitch locklosses will have been missed being tagged by the lockloss tool - our code relies on the glitch surpassing a threshold and then going back down and staying below another threshold for a set amount of time but in a few cases the glitch leads right into the lockloss meaning it doesn't stay below that threshold long enough for the lockloss tool to realize it was an ETM glitch and thus not tagging it. This doesn't happen very often but it's still important to note that there are more ETM glitch locklosses than we have plotted on this histogram.

Ryan tried to take SQZ out checked OPO temp (fine) reset the SQZ angle from 220deg back to a more sensible 190deg and then put SQZ back in again but he couldn't get the FC to lock. Followed steps in the SQZ wiki to touch up FC1/2 alignment and got H1:SQZ-FC_TRANS_C_LF_OUTPUT to >120 plot . but we still were loosing the FC at TRANSION_TO_IR_LOCKING. THE FC also seemed unstable when locked on green. While we were troubleshooting the IFO lost lost. Unsure if this is an ASC issue FC_ASC trends attached (POS for Y and P were moving much more than usual) SQZ ASC trends (ZM4 PIT changes alot).

After we lost lock right at the end of Ryan's shift we were able to get back up relatively easily after I ran an initial alignment. We got knocked out by an earthquake though and we just finished running another initial alignment. The only difficulty in getting relocked for me has been ALSX and Y - they've still been liking to drop out every once in a while even right after an initial alignment. After trying and failing to improve squeezing earlier today (two locks ago) with Ryan squeezing (and subsequently range) also wasn't great when we got relocked this last lock. However an hour in we dropped out due to the SQZ filter cavity unlocking and when it relocked squeezing was back to being around -4db. Not sure what was changed there but it got us back to around 155Mpc which was very appreciated even if it's not an amazing range.

As I'm posting this H1 is unlocked and running an alignment. One lockloss this morning then much of the shift was spent attempting to relock H1 with several failed attempts. After relocking we noticed the range was noticeably lower than recent locks and that DARM in higher frequencies looked poor pointing to SQZ not being optimized. SQZ Troubleshooting: I started by just trying to take SQZ_MANAGER to 'DOWN' then back up to 'FREQ_DEP_SQZ' to see if that would fix the range issue but the FC ASC was not turning on after the FC locked. The SQZ-FC_ASC_TRIGGER_INMON was not reaching its threshold of 3 to turn ASC on so I thought improving FC alignment by adjusting FC2 might help. Ultimately after following the FC alignment instructions from the SQZ troubleshooting wiki the FC would not lock at all in IR so I reverted my FC2 move and then attempted to adjust the OPO temperature. Again following the instructions on the wiki with SQZ_MANAGER in 'LOCK_CF' I was able to improve SQZ-CLF_REFL_RF6_ABS_OUPUT and the FC was able to lock successfully with ASC on. After then taking SQZ_MANAGER all the way up to 'FREQ_DEP_SQZ' I again adjusted the OPO temperature (in the other direction) as both the inspiral range and SQZ BLRMS looked worse than when we had started. I was able to bring these back to about where they were when I dropped observing so ultimately this adventure didn't provide much improvement. H1 then returned to observing.

(See attachment#1 for a look at this mode for the last 24hrs.) I had tried to take the gain to -10 while in Observing but VIOLIN_DAMPING would immediately take the gain back to 0. I chatted with Rahul and he mentions that sometimes this happens. We decided to hold off with this gain for a bit because Rahul was not sure whether taking the VIOLIN_DAMPING guardian from DAMPING_VIOLINS_FULL_POWER to DAMPING_ON_SIMPLE would take us out of Observing but.....we were going to drop out of observing for Calibration shortly. VIOLIN_DAMPING Guardian State Change Takes H1 Out Of OBSERVING At 1930utc took took the violins guardian to DAMPING_ON_SIMPLE and this took us out of OBSERVING. At this point I then ran the calibration. Once the calibration measurement was complete at 2000utc I took IY Mode-1's gain from 0 to it's nominal of -10.0. Then returned the violin guardian to DAMPING_VIOLINS_FULL_POWER. ( See attachment#2 for a look at when the gain was restored.)

They were not present in the early part of yesterday's lock but re-appeared after TJ took a calibration measurement around 22 UTC (were present all night and caused a retraction of a GW alert) and they are not present so far in the current lock which was automatic. Looking at the summary page plots the glitches that come and go are those with SNR between 10 and 30 at 60 and just below 50 Hz. (I can't read the precise frequency from the summary page plot to know if these glitches line up with the PR3 roll mode well or not). When the glitches are on they have a rate of something like 2e-2 Hz (between SNR of 10-20) which means roughly a glitch every 50 seconds more if we include the SNR 20-30 glitches. Hveto doesn't identify an auxillary channel that can veto these glitches. Looking at the range plot there seem to be pretty regular drops in range when the glitches at 50 + 60 Hz are present zooming in the spacing between these range drops is 5-6 minutes although I'm using a channel that only updates every minute.

After this step down the range was also much noisier than it had been before the step ( ndscope1 ). Jane Glanzer ran Lasso for us during this lock stretch ( lasso ) and the top channel that came back with the highest correlation to this range drop was H1:SUS-PI_PROC_COMPUTE_MODE8_NORMLOG10RMSMON with the other channels all having much lower correlation coefficients. This was weird to us because we bandpass and downconvert to monitor mode 8 but we don't monitor or damp it and we don't even turn on its PLL. When you plot the correlated channel along with related PLL channels ( SUS-PI_PROC_COMPUTE_MODE8_PLL_AMP_FILT_OUTPUT SUS-PI_PROC_COMPUTE_MODE8_PLL_LOCK_ST and SUS-PI_PROC_COMPUTE_MODE8_PLL_ERROR_SIG ) you can see there was some weird noise in multiple of these channels that started when the range dropped ( ndscope2 ). I tried plotting a series of PI_PROC_COMPUTE_MODE channels for every mode (there are 32 in total) and out of all of them only mode 8 and mode 24 showed any change in any of their respective channels around the time of the range drop( ndscope3 ). It only being these two channels is very interesting. PI mode 8 comes from the TRX QPD and has a bandpass between 10 and 10.8 kHz. Like I mentioned earlier we do not actively do anything to this channel. Mode 24 on the other hand we definitely monitor and are damping it a lot of the time. Mode 24 is read in from the DCPDs and has a bandpass of and the PI is centered around 10.431 kHz. It is damped by using the ESD on ETMY. Mode 24 actually has more channels that correlate better and have larger amplitudes than mode 8 but Mode 8 NORMLOG10RMSMON correlated better with lasso over the entire lock stretch. Zooming into when the range drop started yesterday we actually see that the large drop in range happened about 12 minutes before we see the huge error signals in the mode 24 PLL and it is at the very beginning of the rise in mode 8 and 24 NORMLOG10RMSMON ( ndscope4 ). Zooming out this excess noise in those PI channels seems to have started early on February 5th aka after relocking after the February 4th maintenance day ( ndscope5 ). On other days the range doesn't seem to have been affected by this noise though at least nowhere near the amount that it was affected yesterday. Sometimes during these periods of noise the range won't be very good (below 155) but other times we'll see this noise in modes 8 and 24 and still be right around or above 160. Since it looks like the range drop yesterday started before the PI channels really started changing we're pretty sure the issue is somewhere else and is just bleeding into these two downconverted channels. Because these two PI channels go through bandpasses in the 10kHz regime there might be something in that frequency range. It is interesting though that although another PI channel we actively monitor Mode 31 is also in the same frequency area (centered at 10.428 kHz) is read from the OMC DCPDs and is damped using ETMY all just like PI24 there doesn't seem to be any coupling into its channels. Either way pretty good leads were made this morning towards finding the actual cause of this range drop. TJ and Camilla looked into the many glitches that appeared then at 60 and 48 Hz as well as noting that the line at 46.1 Hz had grown which is a known PR3 roll mode ( 82924 ).

The confusiong was that our optical gain got better for cold OM2 compared to hot but the loss through HAM6 predicted by stepping the DARM offset and comparing it to the power at the anitsymmetric port predicted that the loss was worse with cold OM2 and gave us unreasonably low (~65 %) throughput estimate for the fundamental TM00 mode through HAM6. We realised that the OM3 and OMC alignment are being changed by the ASC during this time so that could be affecting the comparison. Steps: Turn off OMC ASC at 18:43:00 UTC. Run auto_darm_offset_step.py from /ligo/gitcommon/labutils/darm_offset_step at 18:45:01 UTC. Results: P_AS = 62.996 mW + 1.162 * P_DCPD This makes the throughput estimate for the TM00 mode through HAM6 to the DCPDs to be 86.0 % of the power at the AS port. Which seems more reasonable than the 65% we got last time. We need to do this measurements again when we have improved kappa C somehow to check it gives us the same loss estimate between two times. We were then going to purposely change kappa C as a comparison to the estimate the DARM offset step gives us byt changing the QPD offsets based on this measurement 82383 (I got the sign wrong last time I did this). I turned the OMC ASC back on before doing this however when I changed the H1:ASC-OMC_A_PIT_OFFSET to 0.45 this saturated the OM3 suspension so this was set back to nominal. I think I got signs wrong yet again so we will try what we now think are the correct ones another commissioning period but maybe do it slowly so as not to cause saturations.

Specifically https://git.ligo.org/Calibration/ifo/H1/-/commit/05c153b1f8dc7234ec4d710bd23eed425cfe4d95 which is associated with MR 10 which was intended to add some improvements to the FIR filter generation.Next Louis updated the pydarm install at LHO from tag 20240821.0 to tag 202502220.0 .We then generated the report and associated GDS FIR filters. This is /ligo/groups/cal/H1/reports/20250215T193653Z. The report and fits to the sweeps looked reasonable however the FIR generation did not look good. The combination of the newly updated pydarm and ini changes was producing some nonsensical filter fits. This is the first attachment.We reverted the .ini file changes and this helped to recover more expected GDS filters however there's still a bit of a small ~1% change visible around 10 Hz (instead of being a flat 1.0 ratio) in the filter response using the new pydarm tag versus the old pydarm tag which we don't understand quite yet and would like to before updating the calibration. I'm hoping we can do this in the next day or two after going through the code changes between the versions.Given the measured ~6 Hz SRC detuning spring frequency (as seen in the reports) we will need to include that effect in the calcs front end to eliminate a non-trivial error when we do get around to updating the calibration. I created a quick plot based off the 20250215T193653Z measured parameters comparing the full model over a model without the SRC detuning included.

The PR2 yaw was adjusted such that the PR2-PR3 beam always hits the same spot on PR3. This ensures that the beam spot on PRM and PR3 remain unchanged while the beam spot on PR2 changes.

Plot 3 shows the transmission of the beam with respect PR2 beam spot (As the beam comes closer to the baffle edge some of the beam power is blocked by the baffle edge and hence the transmission decreases) Plot 4 shows the net transmission for the beam (multiplication of Upper edge and Lower edge transmissions) It also shows the experimentally measured data above.

Most of the steps are the same in Sheila's previous alog expect we are in single bounce and we are therefore not looking for the ALS beatnotes instead we are looking at the AS_C_NSUM value. You want to take ISC_Lock to PR2_SPOT_MOVE so that the guardian will adjust the IM4 PR2 yaw sliders while you adjust PR3 sliders so that most everything stays aligned. You will have to adjust the pitch every once in awhile due to the cross couplings in IM4 and PR2. Steps taken in this measurement: Turned ISC_Lock to PR2_SPOT_MOVE Move PR3 yaw using the slider (steps of 10 urad seemed to work for me) or using cdsutils step -s .66 H1:SUS-PR3_Y_OPTICALIGN_OFFSET -- -110 We think the yaw offset value that puts the spot on the center of PR2 is around -230 urad (we started here around 09:00 PST) 3. By going in steps to -900 in yaw offset while pitching PR3 every so often to keep everything centered we were able to move across PR2 to the left edge of the baffle clipping about 10% of the power at the ASC-AS_C QPD (finished 09:45 PST). 4. Then we reset the sliders to their starting values and follwed the above steps going to the right (we stopped at +440 yaw offset).

We had one Lockloss seemingly caused by oscillations in PRCL in the seconds before the losing lock - alog 82916 . According to the first OLG PRCL measurements from alog 82920 Elenna found that the PRCL2 gain was low by about 30-40%. Following this she made a change to up the gain from 1 to 1.4 ( alog 82917 ). Accepted SDF attached. While 1.4 was a bit too high and caused a PRCL ring-up and a LL at LOWNOISE_LENGTH_CONTROL (where the gain switches on) the next setting of 1.2 worked! We were able to fully automatically re-lock and get to NLN and OBSERVING. Before I went into OBSERVING I took another OLG PRCL measurement which is the second measurement in alog 82920 . Other than this the infamous IY Mode 5_6 Violin has been ringing up visible in the top right screen of the attached screenshot which shows mode 6 as slowly increasing since Lock. New settings may be needed for this. Just as I was about to submit we had a LL though there wasn't the characteristic PRCL ring-up from the last few LLs.

This is similar to what Elenna was trying to avoid by adjusting ramp times in 81260 and 81195 which was also at a time when the microseism was high. Oli and I found that the problem with some of our transitions today was that the power on the DCPDs was dropping too low during the initial transition we lost lock when it got to less than 1mA in one of the sucsesful transitions it was as low as 4mA. We edited the guardian to not turn off the darm boost (DARM1 FM1) before making the transition and instead we are turning it off directly after transitioning control back to ETMX before the other filter changes that happen in this state. This is the boost that we thought was causing locklosses when ramping off 81638 which motivated Erik's quadratic ramping change 82263 which was then reverted 82284 82277 . Today Oli and I increased the ramp time on this filter from 10 to 30 seconds. We have make the guardian wait the full 30 seconds for this ramp time so this is making us wait longer in this state. The attached screenshot shows the transition with the boost on on the left and off on the right the wiggle in the DCPD sum is about 1 mA rather than 15mA.

These additional channels were added to the H1EPICS_FMCSSTAT.ini file. DAQ and EDC restart was required WP12339 TW1 raw minute trend file offload Dave: The copy of the last 6 months of raw minute trends from the almost full SSD-RAID on h1daqtw1 was started. h1daqnds1 was temporarily reconfigured to serve these data from their temporary location while the copy proceeds. A restart of h1daqnds1 daqd was needed this was done when the DAQ was restarted for EDC changes. WP12333 New digivideo server and network switch move 4 cameras to new server Jonathan Patrick Fil Dave: A new Cisco POE network switch called sw-lvea-aux1 was installed in the CER below the current sw-lvea-aux. This is a dual powered switch both power supplies are DC powered. Note sw-lvea-aux has one DC and one AC power supply this has been left unchanged for now. Two multimode fiber pairs were used to connect sw-lvea-aux1 back to the core switch in the MSR. For testing four relatively unused cameras were moved from h1digivideo1 to the server h1digivideo4. These are MC1 (h1cam11) MC3 (h1cam12) PRM (h1cam13) and PR3 (h1cam14). The new server IOC is missing two EPICS channels compared with the old IOC _XY and _AUTO. To green up the EDC due to these missing channels a dummy IOC is being ran (see alog). The MC1 MC3 PRM and PR3 camera images on the control room FOM (nuc26) started showing compression issues mainly several seconds of smeared green/magenta horizontal stripes every few minutes. This was tracked to maximizing CPU resources and has been temporaily fixed by stopping one of these camera viewers. EY Timing Fanout Errors Daniel Marc Jonathan Erik Ibrahim Dave: Soon after lunchtime the timing system started flashing RED on the CDS overview. Investigation tracked this down to the EY fanout port_5 (numbering from zero so the sixth physical port). This port sends the timing signal to h1iscey's IO Chassis LIGO Timing Card. Marc and Dave went to EY at 16:30 with spare SFPs and timing card. After swapping these out with no success the problem was tracked to the fanout port itself. With the original SFPs fiber and timing card using port_6 instead of port_5 fixed the issue. For initial SFP switching we just stopped all the models on h1iscey (h1iopiscey h1iscey h1pemey h1caley h1alsey). Later when we replaced the timing cards h1iscey was fenced from the Dolphin fabric and powered down. The operator put all EY systems (SUS SEI and ISC) into a safe mode before the start of the investigation. DAQ Restart Erik Dave: The 0-leg restart was non-optimal. A new EDC restart procedure was being tested whereby both trend-writers were turned off before h1edc was restarted to prevent channel-hopping which causes outlier data. The reason for the DAQ restart was an expanded H1EPICS_FMCSSTAT.ini After the restart of the 0-leg it was discovered that there were some naming issues with the FMCS STAT FCES channels. Erik regenerated a new H1EPICS_FMCSSTAT.ini and the EDC/0-leg were restarted again. Following both 0-leg restarts FW0 spontaneously restarted itself after running only a few minutes. When the EDC and the 0-leg were stable the 1-leg was restarted. During this restart NDS1 came up with a temporary daqdrc serving TW1 past data from its temporary location.

Essentially been dealing with the same issues the whole shift. IFO alignment is actually quite good since we have caught DRMI over 10 times automatically and very quickly but we end up losing lock due to clear instability as a cause of EQs that are exacerbated by over 1 micron/sec secondary microseism. 3 of this shift's EQs have been over 5.0 and we have lost lock around the arrival of the S or R waves each time with 2 of those being at TRANSITION_FROM_ETMX around an hour into acquisition resulting in the long lock acquisitions we're experiencing. Other than TRANSITION we've lost lock at or before DRMI with ASC and LSC signals oscillating a lot. As I type this we just lost lock for the 3rd time at around LOWNOISE_ESD_ETMX so there is potentially something wrong with this state specifically despite CPS signals showing noise at the same time as the lockloss. The good news is I haven't been experiencing ALS issues at all this shift.

We tried replacing the timing card itself but no sync was possible using the new SFPs. Installing the original SFPs restored the sync but the timing problem was still there. Moving to the unused port_7 (seventh port) of the fanout fixed the problem.

The installation work was carried out in the last few weeks the last step - the startup by Rogers Machinery - happened today.This new system has a 69 cfm air delivery operating with 3 pcs. of 7.5 HP motors (in sum 22.5 HP). In comparison the old system had a 50 cfm air delivery operating with 5 pcs. of 5 HP motors (in sum 25 HP). Moreover the new system (unlike the old one) has an automatic dew point monitor and a complete pair of redundant dryer towers.So this new system is a major improvement. The reason for this 69 cfm limit (and not more) is that the cooling of the compressor units in the MER is still feasible moreover the filters and the airline do not need any upgrades they can still accommodate the airflow.Both the new and old systems are able to produce at least -40 deg F dew point air on paper. During the startup the new system was however able to produce much better than this - it was ~-70 deg F (and dropping) - as you can see in the attached photo.Last but not least a huge congratulations to the Vacuum team for the installation as this was the first instance when the installation of a clean air system was carried out by LIGO staff so this is indeed a huge achievement. Also big thanks to Chris who cleaned some parts for the compressor to Tyler who helped a lot in the heavy lifting and to Richard & Ken who did the electrical wiring.From next week on we repeat this same installation at the EY station. ,"{'term': 'LHO VE', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",82886,janos.csizmazia@ligo.org

Short After the recent PRC alignment work (moving PR3 to better center the beam on PR2) the OpLev beam had fallen off of its QPD so today I attempted to re-center the QPD. Using only the translation stages I could not re-center the QPD since the horizontal translation stage hit its max travel limit well before the beam was back on the QPD (SUM counts went from ~700 to ~850 well short of the usual ~22k). I enlisted Ryan S. to help and we set out to adjust the OpLev beam alignment from the transmitter. Turns out that the beam gets clipped before we can get it centered on the QPD. We first tried to move the translation stage away from its limit but could only get the beam on 2 of the QPD segments (segments 1 and 3) before the SUM counts started dropping at no point could we get the beam onto QPD segments 2 and 4 in this configuration. We then moved the horizontal stage to its limit and tried to align the beam onto the QPD this worked a little better but still not great. The best SUM counts we could get and have a ""centered"" QPD was ~17k roughly 75% of the total SUM counts for this OpLev so still some significant clipping. We decided to unclip the beam to make the OpLev more trustworthy (we've had questions about this OpLev in the past). Max SUM counts were ~22.7k and this gives a Yaw reading of roughly -12.5 µrad any closer to zero and the beam begins to clip again. We left the OpLev in this configuration and will investigate the clipping at a later date. Tagging OpsInfo: Around -12.5 µrad is the current ""yaw zero"" for the PR3 OpLev until we can figure out and alleviate the clipping. As for the clipping my best guess at this point is we're clipping somewhere on/in the ~4' long tube that runs from the exit viewport for the OpLev receiver and the OpLev's QPD. We'll have to climb on top of HAM3 to check this which we will do at a later date. This closes WPs 12336 and 12341 . Edit: Fixed typo in yaw reading in bolded sentence (12.7 to 12.5).

Summary: Today we measured the powers on SQZT0 see attached photo. Aimed to understand where we were loosing our green light as we had to turn down the OPO setpoint last week 82787 . Adjusted SHG EOM AOM and fiber pointing are dramatically increased available green light. OPO setpoint back to 80uW with plenty of extra green avaible. After taking the attached power measurements we could see we the SHG conversion was fine 130mW green out of SHG for 360mW of IR in. We were loosing a lot of power through the EOM 96mW in to 76mW out (expect ~100%). We could see this clipping in yaw by taking a photo. Sheila adjusted the EOM alignment increasing the power out to 95mW. Then AOM and fiber aligned following 72081 : 1) set the ISS drive point at 0V to make only 0th order beam and check 90% of AOM throughput with power meter. Started with 95mW in 50mW out. Improved to 95mW in 80mW out = 84%. 2) set the ISS drive point at 5V and align the AOM to maximize the 1st order beam (which is left side of 0th order beam looking from the laser side of SQZT0). After the AOM alignment the 1st order beam was 27.5 mW and the 0th order beam was 49 mW. We measured again the AOM throughput including both 0th and 1st order beam. The AOM throughput was 77.5mW/93mW = 83%. 3) set the ISS drive point at 5V and align the fiber by maximizing the H1:SQZ-OPO_REFL_DC_POWER. I needed to adjust the SHG waveplate to reduce power to stop PD saturating After this alignment the SHG output is 42.7 mW the pump going to fiber is 20.5 mW and the rejected power is 2.7 mW. The ISS can be locked with OPO trans of 80uW while the ISS control monitor is 7.0. Also checked the OPO temperature. Note that depending on the SHG PZT voltage the power does change. Maybe cause by an alignment change form the PZT. As ISS control monitor is 7.0 is a little high with 26.5mW SHG launched (OPO unlocked) I further turned the SHG launch power down to 20mW and adjusted the HAM7 rejected light. ISS control monitor left at 5.4 which is closer to the middle of the 0-10V range.

The attached trace shows the ISS drivepoint signal CLF launch power (into the fiber that goes to HAM7) and CLF rejected power (before the fiber and the launch monitor PD - this is just a tap to dump the extra power). In the last 36 hours all three channels have been trending up. CLF ISS drives the AOM that comes before both CLF launch power and CLF rejected power so it worth noting that over 24 hours (-1.5 days to -0.5 days) while the change in CLF rejected power has been ~100% increase CLF launch power shows ~10% increase. This contributes to the disproportionate increase in the CLF ISS drive. Perhaps the PDs need to be recalibrated or something happened to the HWP that sets the power division (see temperature readback from the HWP that doesn't show a monotonic increase or decrease to easily blame on). Either way I adjusted the power division and the issue was fixed. After this fix the squeezer locked within 5 minutes. I saw the FC green trans signal was down to ~700 counts (compared to ~1300 we usually have with good alignment) and the green beam was very off on the FC REFL camera. Despite the bad alignment the FC managed to go all the way up and lock IR. But since this can lead to lost time later in the night if we lose lock I decided to take us out of observe and spend another few minutes to offload FC ASC and tweak FC alignment (~1400 counts). This cost us about 7 minutes in total and we went back to observe without any issues. The issues with OPO ISS CLF ISS and FC alignment are expected during severe temperature changes. So we should actively keep an eye out for these when such changes happen. OPO ISS monitor is 5.6 V and CLF ISS monitor is 5.2 V currently so we should be fine.

We reverted the old pitch settings except I put the dither frequency at 1725.1Hz instead of 1750.1Hz (from 1600.1Hz) as I felt the resonace was a little lower than it was before but this means we have to make new notches in the BLRMS instead of restoring old filters so we plan to shift this to 1750.1Hz on the next lock.

I double checked the voltage at the racks in the mech room and the values were all over +18V or +24V in the respective racks.

The support tubes are the best approximation we can have for the table top position without the chamber vented ( see similar work for HAM6 when vented ). We found that HAM1 support tubes as-built is shifted relative to the CAD +4 mm in X and +4 mm in Y and is pretty much dead-on in Z . This level of error in the support tube positions is reasonable when compared to the other deviations we have seen around the LVEA . While the current HAM1 table top might not have the exact same shift as the support tubes in all likelihood it is shifted somewhat in +X and +Y. For the upcoming ISI install it is likely that the support tubes are going to move. These measurements will help us better recover the position of HEPI and the new ISI table. From the photos/drawings I have looked at HAM1 it is not clear to me if the optics position on the table account for the shift at all so it is likely best to put the center of the ISI where the center of the current table is. All this being said we will measure the current table position during the vent to confirm the table shift. ,"{'term': 'L1 SYS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",75341,timothy.ohanlon@ligo.org

In the attached PDF I took the median of the ASD from 500-700 Hz subtracted dark noise in quadrature from each ASD then calculated the dB relative to shot noise for squeezing anti-squeezing and mean squeeze. I used the squeezing and anti-squeezing and opo transmission numbers to fit for the OPO threshold (in units of transmitted power) total efficiency of squeezing and phase noise. The attached plot shows the resulting model plotted against the data including mean squeezing and NLG measurements that were not used for fitting. The NLG plot does suggest that we are slightly underestimating our NLG with our measurements. This suggests that the OPO threshold is at 156uW transmitted power and that the totall efficiency is 83%. This can be compared to 73365 and to the expected losses from the loss tracking sheet and sqz wiki .

Almost every relock since then has seen these glitches. They almost always start showing up in OFFLOAD_DRMI_ASC but I've found a few instances( one two three ) where the noise clearly starts during DRMI_LOCKED_CHECK_ASC the state before OFFLOAD_DRMI_ASC.

In this aLog in the comments the progress of this operation is tracked continuously until the 1st startup by the supplier Rogers Machinery.Another important consideration here is that the purge line at EY needs to be replaced (based on an FTIR test - see DCC LIGO-E2300222-v2. As it can be seen the level of contamination reaches even the 10 ug/cm2 value). This operation will be done after the April-May vent so the EY station will be ready to be vented after O4.02-25 (maintenance Tuesday): the old compressor was pulled out (it is temporarily stored in the EY receiving area). The beginning of the purge and TMDS lines with the associated brackets and unistruts were taken off. The new compressor unit and dryer skid were anchored in the mechanical room. Here it is important to mention that the orientation of the inlet was brought closer to the purge line inlet into the VEA so the overall length of the associated circulation lines will be much shorter.Next is the electrical and pneumatic installation which will be completed in the next 1-2 weeks. ,"{'term': 'LHO VE', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",83066,janos.csizmazia@ligo.org

We had some issues at first which ended up being that with HAM7 ISI tripped the optics were moving around too much plot of optics here . After we fixed that we retook the data so that our real data set is in 83039 . Below documents the steps taken and initial data that we ended up not trusting. Checked LO shot noise (LO on HD Seed blocked) and HD dark noise (both beams blocked) Sheila increased Seed power form 0.5mW to 70mW. SQZ_MANAGER to LOCKED_SEED_DITHER. Went onto SQZT7 plugged oscilloscope into the outside of the table. Adjusted LO power to match. Then both Seed and LO beams on the HD Seed PZT scanning starting visibility 89% (max-min/max+min) adjusted SQZ path optics to increase visibility to 98.6% Sheila decreased Seed power to 0.2mW. Then started data taking: NLG measured at (Toggle SQZ/HD path and follow 76542 ) Took SQZ_MANAGER to SQZ_READY_HD (FC2 misaligned) and take data on HD DTT Change opo_grTrans_setpoint_uW in sqzparams.py reload OPO guardian take it to NO_ISS and then back to LOCKED_CLF_DUAL to check it can reach opo_grTrans_setpoint_uW Repeat Sheila and Matt measured the LO OLG as 2.5kHz 80deg phase margin is LO loop with gain -12 LO on LOCKED_HD with opo_grTrans_setpoint_uW = 80uW before we started. One we got to the 110uW measurements we felt the squeezing was unstable moving independently of the SQZ angle steps taken to help this: Sheila and Matt measured the LO OLG it was the same as before so it's changing significantly with OPO trans power OPO loop measured 1.7kHz was UGF last week this week looks very different changed gain from -8 to - 14 plots in 83039 . CLF loop had 13.7kHz UGF with plenty of phase margin was 12kHz last week. Realized that the ZM optics were noisy with HAM7 tripped and the increased (60mph!! wind) see plot .

The whitening was safe to turn on minutes after I started looking at it but the SQZer couldn't lock the FC. Once I fixed the FC alignment I had to futz with the SQZ ASC then all was well. There were some SDF diffs. Violin modes 5&6 of ITMY aren't damping well not a new issue. Back to Observing at 0905UTC. SQZ H1:SQZ-FC_TRANS_C_OUTPUT wasn't getting flashes above 17 (the wiki says it should be above 100). I followed the instructions in the wiki and adjusted FC2 to get good flashes in the cavity and eventually got it to lock. It was left with a ""FC ASC not on??"" notification. Sure enough H1:SQZ-FC_ASC_TRIGGER_INMON was at 1.5 still lower than the recently lower 2.0 trigger threshold( alog82853 ). I tried to touch up FC2 a bit more and got the trans output up to 112 but the trigger input was still at 1.5. I cycled SQZ_FC guardian node and was back in the same place. I then lowered the threshold to 1.5 and it turned on the ASC temporarily raising the trans output and bringing the trigger input to 4.5. Range was at 146Mpc but we were still thermalizing so I didn't want to tune much else. SDFs There were two SDFs - H1:LSC-LOCKIN_1_OSC_TRAMP and H1:SYS-MOTION_C_PICO_I_CURRENT_ENABLE both reverted. Violins While I was here I checked to make sure the violins were damping well. All seemed good except maybe ITMY 5&6. We've recently gone through some gain and phase changes to this mode ( alog82977 alog82963 ). At this point mode 5 looked to be slowly decreasing but mode 6 wasn't really moving. This was better than increasing though so I left the settings as they were. ","{'term': 'H1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",83060,thomas.shaffer@ligo.org

Then on acquisition 6 I forgot to pause at the state and we continued on and it was all good there were also zero suspension saturations this time but there the shaking/fuzziness was still present. I was looking at the ASC_OVERVIEW medm while this was happening and noticed that the TMS's output was higher than typical ? Especially TMSY in P & Y.

To further this investigation I started photographing the area around the ITMs and BS as best I coluld through our viewports (there is not a good view towards HAM3). I found several unexpected distributions of light in the vertex: 1. 20 degree conical annular beams from ITMs Both ITMX/CPX (Figure 1) and ITMY/CPY (Figure 3) cast an expanding annular “beam” towards the BS with a cone half angle of roughly 20 degrees from the main beam. My best guess is that it is produced by arm cavity light hitting the bevel of the ITMs (see cartoon in Figure 1). A good test of this would be to install the new test mass cage baffles at one or more of the ITMs at LLO (presuming Anamaria finds this beam at LLO) this upcoming break. The baffle should hide the bevel and eliminate the ring of light. 2. 45 degree conical annular beams from BS The BS appears to cast an expanding annular “beam” with a cone half angle of 45 degrees centered around the -X -Y direction (Figure 2) and likely another annular beam also with a half angle of 45 degrees centered around the -X +Y direction (evidence in Figure 3). I tried to find a geometry where the bevels were also the source of these beams but didn’t. My best guess is that the annular cone is produced by reflections of light from PR3 and the ITMs off of the inner surface of the circular cage around the BS or the inside surface of the circular barrel of the BS itself (see drawings on third page of Figure 2). 3. Reflection of BS in ITM elliptical baffles likely visible at ITMY and HAM3 The BS beam spot is reflected towards ITMY by the slanted piece of the ITMX elliptical baffle (Figure 3). While the actual beam is not reflected towards ITMY (it isn’t clipped) the baffle reflects light towards ITMY that is scattered out of the main beam by only a few degrees.

48125,H1 CAL - Pcal XY comparison investigation - repeating upper beam move center to left,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=83051,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Tue, 25 Feb 2025 18:15:35 -0800","FLlamas - Tuesday 2025-02-25 Start of report Moved the Pcal upper beam at END-X to test for repeatability of the results seen on LHO:78373 . Recap: As seen on first figure ( chi_klm ) the red squares highlight the inconsistency when moving the upper and the lower beam to the same direction (left aperture on target - fourth and fifth figures show the target ) on the ETM. The other moves are consistent between upper and lower beam. Additionally the second ( 2024_06_11_transition_upper_center2left_rawpcals_out ) and third ( 2024_06_18_transition_upper_left2center_rawpcals_out ) figure show the Pcal channels during the upper beam moving from the target center aperture to the left aperture and back. The blue color is for the PD values before making an actuation the orange is for the values after the actuation the title tells the actuation direction on the target and the x-axis is the time needed to average 10 hours within lock for each state (10 hrs before and 10 hrs after). From these plots we see that during the upper-beam actuation to the left and back the END-X Tx sensor - middle-left plot - decreased by 8 HOPs and 6 HOPs affecting chi_XY. The END-X Rx value - top-left plot - dropping by 20 HOPs suggests additional losses of the beam downstream from the Tx sensor potentially from clipping but it is hard to see with the Tx changing simultaneously. There was an initial concern at the time of moving the upper beam that the actuations to the right aperture were the inconsistent ones but after moving the lower beam we can have more confidence on the values corresponding to an actuation to the right aperture and raise concern on the actuations done to the left aperture. Today: Went to END-X to move the upper Pcal beam by actuating on yaw of the last folding mirror before the vacuum window (aka: the ""inner beam"" folding mirror.) The objective is to maximize the signal measured by the Rx PD when the target is in place. This is done by blocking the beam that will not be used and monitor the actuated beam with a voltmeter reading from ""RX PD Mon"" from the Pcal interface chassis (D1400153). The table below documents each relevant step from the procedure and the voltage used to assess such step. Step Comment Keithley Voltage [V] 1 Both beams 3.387 ± 2e-3 2 Block outer (lower) beam 1.682 ± 1e-3 3 Target on (fourth figure InnerBeamBefore ) 1.412 ± 5e-3 4 After actuation (fifth figure InnerBeamAfter ) 1.570 ± 2e-3 5 Target off 1.683 ± 1e-3 6 Unblock outer beam 3.389 ± 2e-3 The increase in signal after the actuation could be from clipping on the center aperture. An extra step between 3 and 4 where the beam is ""optimized"" on the center aperture would reveal if there is such clipping. The previous alog from a Pcal upper-beam actuation to the left agrees that this location increases the Voltage signal from RX PD Mon but the data shows 20 Hops of clipping... odd. Nominal plan is to get a few hours of lock to assess the results from this actuation and return the beam to it's nominal ""center"" state on the following maintenance Tuesday.

Chiefly I slightly tweaked PMC alignment to see if I could change the variation seen in PMC Refl and then revisited the amplifier pump diode injection currents after our previous measurement of the pump diode slopes . PMC Beam Alignment Tweak I first tweaked the beam alignment to the PMC using our pico mounts. With the ISS OFF PMC Refl was hovering around 23.6 W and after a couple of small tweaks PMC Refl was hovering around 23.4 W this was the lowest I could get PMC Refl. PMC Trans increased by roughly the same amount it began hovering around 104.9 W and ended hovering around 105.1 W. Not a large improvement but also not unexpected. I turned the ISS back ON and let things sit and collect data for 15 minutes or so then took a look at the variation in PMC Refl before and after the tweak. Before today's tweak PMC Refl was moving roughly 0.45 W peak-to-peak and after it was moving roughly 0.27 W peak-to-peak. This is closer to the variation before last week's alignment tweak so I left the alignment here. Will check in on this later to see if it holds. Amplifier Pump Diodes That done I took a look at the injection current for the amplifier pump diodes. From our diode slope measurements a couple of weeks ago the pump diodes are outputting more power than they were at install. Case in point at install we were seeing ~68 W out of Amp1 with 9.0 A of injection current to all 4 pump diodes now with 9.0 A for diodes 1 and 2 and 8.8 A for diodes 3 and 4 we have ~71.5 W out of Amp1. Keep in mind the pump diodes are powered in groups of 2. So for Amp1 power supply 1 supplies pump diodes 1 and 2 and power supply 2 supplies pump diodes 3 and 4 (power supply 3 supplies Amp2 diodes 1 and 2 and power supply 4 supplies Amp2 diodes 3 and 4) this means that whenever we change the current of one power supply we are changing the injection current for 2 pump diodes. Amp1 first. Looking at the slope measurements to get close to our pump diode output powers at install the injection currents need to be set at 8.7 A for all 4 diodes. To see how this affects our PMC Trans/Refl relation I turned OFF the ISS again and set the Amp1 injection current to 8.7 A for both power supplies. This dropped Amp1 output to ~69.2 W (from ~71.5 W) Amp2 output to ~138.3 W (from ~141.0 W). PMC Refl dropped to ~22.8 W and PMC Trans dropped to ~104.0 W (from ~23.5 W and ~105.2 W respectively). PMC Refl remained ~22% of PMC Trans after this change (21.8% vs 22.3%) so this implies a straight power drop with no real change in the beam quality. Since this is as close to the install output power as I can get I recalibrated the pump diode power monitors for Amp1 at this point as based on the slope measurements we're clearly not outputting between 85% and 95% of our install output power (which is what the Amp1 pump diode monitors read at this injection current). I set both Amp1 power supplies to 8.8 A as this gave a good balance of output power PMC Trans/Refl ratio and pump diode output power. At this point Amp1 was outputting ~70.2 W Amp2 was outputting ~140.1 W PMC Refl was ~23.1 W and PMC Trans was ~104.7 W. Next I took a look at Amp2. We had tested putting Amp2 back to its install injection current (8.6 A) when we recovered the PMC after the pump diode slope measurements and this was not great for the PMC Refl increased and Trans decreased by large amounts. So even though Amp1 is happy with similar pump diode power vs install Amp2 seems to want more. Now this was putting the Amp2 injection current back to the install level but not looking at the actual pump diode output power. To get close to the Amp2 pump diode output powers at install the injection current would have to be lowered even more (8.3 A for diodes 1 and 2 and 8.4 A for diodes 3 and 4). The table below summarizes the results I saw when changing the injection current for Amp2 I've bolded the row that represents the closest I can get to our install pump diode output powers based on our diode slope measurements from a couple weeks ago. Amp2 Injection Current (A) LD1/2 LD3/4 Amp2 Output Power (W) PMC Trans (W) PMC Refl (W) 9.1 9.1 ~140.1 ~104.7 ~23.1 8.8 8.8 ~141.0 ~97.2 ~28.3 8.6 8.6 ~142.4 ~91.4 ~32.5 8.3 8.4 ~138.6 ~83.1 ~38.7 9.2 9.2 ~140.1 ~106.2 ~22.3 First things first we are currently overpumping Amp2 as seen by the behavior of Amp2 output with the changes in injection current. However as the injection current of Amp2 is decreased the PMC gets less and less happy with the transmitted power dropping quickly despite there being little change in the power output from Amp2 and a slight increase in injection current reduces PMC Refl while keeping Amp2 output the same. I can think of 2 reasons for this off the top of my head: these lower pump powers result in more power in higher order modes vs the fundamental mode or our Amp2-to-PMC mode matching is somewhat less than ideal when the amplifier is not overpumped (I'm leaning towards the latter we've suspected for a while that PMC mode matching isn't ideal). To test this we would have to take beam propagation measurements on the beam at these different injection current levels. IFF there is enough time during the upcoming break in O4 (we would probably need 2 or 3 days likely after the vent work) we want to revisit PMC mode matching so we would take a look at this then. I also want to note that at the install pump diode output power (bolded row) Amp2 output was very noisy varying by roughly +/-1.5 W. I also tried 9.3 A injection current on all 4 pump diodes but this yielded very little improvement over 9.2 A (~0.2 W better for both PMC Trans and Refl). Despite slightly overpumping Amp2 I left the Amp2 injection currents at 9.2 A as the PMC is performing better at this current setting we will revisit this if/when we take a look at PMC mode matching. I then recalibrated the Amp2 pump diode monitors to more accurately reflect the amount of power they are outputting now vs install. Before and after pictures of the pump diode monitor calibration factors are attached (looking at the PumpPD column). To end I turned on the ISS and adjusted the RefSignal to -2.0 V so it was diffracting ~4% (RefSignal adjustment necessary since PMC Trans increased by ~1.5 W) at 12:30 PST when I finished PMC Refl was ~22.3 W and PMC Trans was ~106.4 W. ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",83035,jason.oberling@ligo.org

As Camilla notes above the NLG measurements here don't nicely fit a model for a consistent threshold power. Instead of using the NLG data I've allowed the threshold power to be one of the parameters that varies in the fit along with total efficiency and phase noise. In principle one could also use this data to estimate the technical nosie that limits squeezing but I haven't tried that with just a few points here.

This was aiming to give us a improvement in optical gain . After doing this we aimed to measure the anti-symmetric port light changing as we chnage the darm offset. We are trying to use both these measurements to narrow down where we have optical loss in that could be limiting our observed squeezing. Performed both measurments successfully but the different alignment of the OMC made the squeezing less good so Camilla (alog #83009) needed to do some tuning. Last time (alog #82938 ) I did this I used the wrong values as our analysis used the output channels to the loops instead of the input channels which come before the offsets are put in. The new analysis of our measurement of the optical gain as seen by the 410Hz PCAL line changing with QPD offset shows that we want the loop inputs to change to: H1:ASC_OMC_A_PIT_INMON to 0.3 -> so we should change H1:ASC_OMC_A_PIT_OFFSET to -0.3 H1:ASC_OMC_A_YAW_INMON to -0.15 -> so we should change H1:ASC_OMC_A_YAW_OFFSET to 0.15 H1:ASC_OMC_B_PIT_INMON to 0.1 -> so we should change H1:ASC_OMC_B_PIT_OFFSET to -0.1 H1:ASC_OMC_B_YAW_INMON to 0.025 - so we should change H1:ASC_OMC_B_YAW_OFFSET to -0.025 We stepped these up in steps of around 0.01 to 0.02 while monitoring the saturations on OMC and OM3 suspensions and the optical gain both to make sure we were going in the correct direction and that we were not near to saturation of the suspensions as hapenened last time I tried to do this. Attached is the code and the ndscope showing the steps on each offset (top row left plot top row center right plot second row left plot second row center right plot). The top stage osems for OM3 suspension are shown in the third row left plot the top stage osems for OMC suspension are in the third row center left plot and the optical gain is shown in the third row right plot. The optical gain improved from by 0.0113731 from a starting value of 1.00595 so that is an improvement of 1.13 % in optical gain. Around 19:04:28 UTC I started the DARM offset step to see if the change in optical gain matches that we would see if we measured the throughput of HAM 6. Unfortuntely I forgot to turn off the OMC ASC which we know affects this measurement of the loss. We stood down from changing the OMC and Camilla did some squeezer measurements then I made the same mistake again the next time I tried to run it (d'oh). Both times I control-C'd the auto_darm_offset.py form the command line which means the starting PCAL line values and DARM offset had to be reset manually before I ran the script successfully after turning the OMC ASC gain to 0 to turn it off. The darm offset measurement started at 19:20:31 UTC. The code to run it is /ligo/gitcommon/darm_offset_step/auto_darm_offset_step.py The results are saved in /ligo/gitcommon/darm_offset_step/data and /ligo/gitcommon/darm_offset_step/figures/plot_darm_optical_gain_vs_dcpd_sum . From the final plot in the attached pdf the transmission of the fundamental mode light between ASC_AS_C (anti-symmetric port) DCPD is (1/1.139)*100 = 87.8 %. We can compare this to the previous measurement from last week with the old QPD offsets to see if the optical loss change matches what we would expect from such a change in optical gain.

For CPY a third shelf appears when I turned off the ailgnment offsets that Robert set to reduce the noise he sees while shaking the input arm. From Accadia et al the shelf frequency = abs(2*velocity of scatterer/lambda). So our first shelf at 17Hz comes from some path with a velocity of 9 um/second the second fringe at 33Hz from a path with twice that velocity at 17.5um/second and the third fringe which only shows up for CPY with no offsets is at three times that velocity at 50Hz (27um/second). The max veolcity of R0 should be 2 *pi*0.2 Hz * 7.7um/2 = 4.8um/second. That's consistent with the first shelf being from some scatter path hits the CP twice so it scatters out of the cavity by being reflected off one of the CP faces and also scatters back in by a reflection off the CP. Side note the damping signals for the two CPs seem rather different I will try to come back later to look at why they are so different. Editing to add after looking at the damping loops with help from Jeff: ITMY's R0 F2 has a lot of 60Hz noise. Jeff suggests copying the 60Hz notch filter from the main chain damping loops into the oseminf filter banks for the reaction chain and he recomends doing this for F1F2 F3 and SD since these are all on the same electronics chain. At first it seems that we have rather different settings between the R0 damping filters for ITMX + ITMY but the gains for ITMX are incorporated into filter banks in the end the damping loops seem to be the same. The attached spectrum comparison shows that the motion of the two reaction chains looks similar on the osems. ,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",83003,sheila.dwyer@ligo.org

We did not see any change in PMC Trans with the tweak but clearly the PMC Refl signal became more noisy. At this time I'm not sure why this happened. We've seen in the past that the PMC alignment being off can cause the Refl signal to get very noisy which is cured by fixing the alignment. Not the case here as the alignment was already good when we tried to tweak it. I don't see anything in the other trends that would indicate a reason behind this more noisy PMC Refl.

The PMC Refl rise appears to coincide with a temperature change in the enclosure and LVEA. Seen on the Weekly Environment plots there is a clear downward change in all 4 temperature sensors in the PSL enclosure Laser Room (TBLN TBLS ACN ACS) and a clear drop and levelling out of the temperature in the enclosure Anteroom and the PSL LVEA sensor (sits on the exterior PSL enclosure wall between the enclosure and HAM1). This is also seen on a couple of items exposed to ambient temperatures namely the NPRO laser pump diodes (in the NPRO laser head in the enclosure Laser Room) and the LVEA Control Box (in the PSL rack outside of the enclosure). On the Weekly Cooling set of plots a clear change in these 3 channels (*_NPRO_LD[1/2]TEMP *_CB1_TEMP) is seen coincident with the temperature change witnessed by the various PSL temperature sensors. Seeing this we attempted a brief alignment tweak of the PMC beam from the Control Room (theory being that since the change in PMC Refl coincides with a temperature change maybe an temperature-induced alignment shift caused the increase in PMC Refl). Unfortunately we saw no change in PMC Trans with an alignment tweak.,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",83015,jason.oberling@ligo.org

Recently Ben was working a Data Quality Shift and reported that the peak had moved by tenths of a Hz and had increased dramatically in amplitude ( 82519 ). This week I used a speaker to sweep in the region around 35 Hz and found that there was a sharp maximum in vibration coupling that happened to lie just where the HVAC peak has been for the last couple of months (See Figure). This meant that if we could move it just a little in frequency we would reduce the amplitude in DARM. We power some of the HVAC equipment with variable frequency drives (VFD) which convert the mains 60 Hz to other frequencies. We set the office area air handler VFD to 69 Hz instead of the 72 Hz that it had been running at and greatly reduced the amplitude of the peak in DARM (see Figure page 2).

I have configured SQZ-OPO_TEC_LOCKIN_DRIVE to oscillate at 25mHz which creates 50mHz oscillations witnessed in SQZ-CLF_REFL_RF6_ABS_HP_INMON and SQZ-EST_RF6_NGL_OUTPUT with a peak amplitude of 5mV which creates at temperature oscillation of about 0.01 peak degrees C in the OPO. The amplitude is small enough that when the temperature is tuned correctly there are no visible oscillations in the witnesses. The demodulation of the dither is in SQZ-CLF_REFL_RF6_ABS_DEMOD_OUTPUT which has a 10mHz bandwidth. This will be within the bandwidth of my eventual squeezing angle servo which will have a bandwidth of 100mHz (provisionally witnessed through SQZ-ADF_OMC_TRANS_SQZ_ANG) so that squeezing angle will stay optimised throughout the slow changes in OPO temperature. I'm assembling an eventual squeezing angle Guardian inspired by LHO's but will also actively optimise OPO temperature and will be set to not do anything until at least 2 hours into the lock which is roughly how long it takes for everything to thermalise enough that error signals are trustworthy.

Both individual beam voltage values as found were very similar to the values recorded at the end of the move done last week. We actuated by turning counterclockwise on the pitch adjuster of the outer beam folding mirror with minor adjustments in yaw.

We expect to see a large (~20 HOPs) change in \chi_XY. From our investigations -- an independent method to estimate IFO beam offset using the Pcal -- we believe that the IFO beam offset when facing the ETM is (+ 14.3 mm -- 09.3 mm) in cartesian coordinates. These coordinates yield an angle of arctan(-- 9.3/14.3) ~ -- 33 deg from the horizontal axis of the ETM center. The first pdf file ( polar_out.pdf ) plots the IFO beam offset. The black points represent the measurements of a2l (located at '/opt/rtcds/userapps/trunk/isc/common/scripts/decoup/BeamPosition/a2l_lookup.m'). The green points are what is inferred by Pcal measurements. For the Pcal to estimate the IFO beam offset we use the scalar product of \vec(c) -- the displacement vector of the Pcal center of force for a given actuation and \vec(b) -- the IFO center of force as it is derived in T2400032 equation 11 . From the plot there is a clear disagreement on the horizontal component of the IFO beam from both methods. Following equation 11 a measurement in which an actuation from the Pcal beams results in a parallel displecement of the pcal center of force to the real IFO beam center of force should maximize the change \chi_XY. Conversely an actuation that is perpendicular would not be seen by \chy_XY (no change). The actuation for today was parallel to what the Pcal estimates is the IFO beam position. We plan to make a second actuation in which we move perpendicular to our estimate of the IFO beam. Ideally these measurements would increase our confidence of the IFO offset. We aligned the target by setting an angle gauge at the calculated 33 deg as seen in the first image ( TARGET_ON ). We aligned the Pcal beams to the corresponding apertures by (1) blocking one beam and (2) aligned beam of interest by maximizing the Rx sensor voltage readout from a Keithley digital multimeter (KVM). Since the upper beam has shown inconsistencies in the horizontal displacement ( 83051 ) we are actuating on the lower beam. The second image ( BOTH_BEAMS ) shows both beams after moving the lower beam. The following table lists the voltage value at each relevant step of the process: Step Comment Rx Readout [V] 1 Both beams as found 2.840 2 Upper beam as found 1.440 3 Upper beam centered 1.50 4 Lower beam as found 1.396 5 Lower beam centered 1.40 6 Lower beam moved 1.390 Some observations from today's visit to ENDX: Clockwise rotation on the yaw actuator moved the lower beam up on the Rx sensor. Clockwise rotation on the pitch actuator moved the lower beam to the right on the Rx sensor. Noticed an increase in upper (inner) beam after optimizing on center aperture -- so the beams may drift in the order of less than 1 mm on the Rx (roughly half on the ETM) during the span of a week. Power imbalance of ~7% of both beams on the center aperture when the target was on . This is the first of three actuations. Additionally the data processing still needs about a week of data to diagnose results. We will have nominal results in ~3 weeks.

Freed Today I collected 2 phase noises first phase noise is of the 80 MHz OCXO after it has gone through an RF distributer. The reference was the SRS SG382 at 80MHz The second is of the Double Mixer again but with an extra focus on the 8192Hz sideband.The reference was agian the SRS SG382 at 80MHz-4096Hz These tests was done with the direct plug in method without using a PLL. This requires both the device under test and the reference device to be at quadrature. Normally a PLL is required to keep them there however since both devices are connected to the LIGO timing system in some way a PLL is unnecessary to keep them locked in quadrature. To put them in quadrature I just lined them up on an oscilloscope best I could then added 90 deg by adjusting the phase on the SRS. I bypassed the internal amp of the BluePhase1000 for all tests. DM_vs_RF.pdf Is a plot of the two phase noises as seen the low frequency noise (<2Hz) has these humps. I now attribute these to the RF distributer causeing a shape change in the pure sin wave signal.

Here are some notes to future me and others to reference if we want to do single bounce scans: align one ITM. We chose ITMY today because of work happening with the oplev that required ITMY to be aligned for this scan I increased the input power to 10 W first check if the fast shutter is OPEN (silly mistake spent a few minutes wondering where the beam was) take the OMC guardian to DOWN. After the fast shutter mistake TJ and I were fighting to scan and realized that the guardian was set to ""OFF_RESONANCE"" and overriding us as we scanned I turned on the AS centering loops by hand DC3 and DC4 P/Y (this aligns OM1 and 2 onto the AS WFS) To ensure alignment to AS_C was good TJ and I ran SR2_ALIGN in the ALIGN_IFO guardian (after this I had to reengage the DC centering loops because the ALIGN_IFO guardian turned them off going to DOWN) I saw an off-centered beam on the OMC QPDs so I engaged the OMC ASC master gain which centered the QPDs There was a moment where I thought the PZT2 offset mattered so I changed it. I see now that it probably didn't matter and only effects where the scan starts I used an OMC scan template in [userapps] omc/h1/templates/OMC_scan_single_bounce.xml run some scans!

There are multiple Locklosses in this section of the CAL Sweep but there seems to be a common 40ish Hz oscillation on top of the 1200Hz that apears when we loose lock But not when we survive it . I am aware that there is an alog 82827 that mentions a 43.75 hz signal... which may need to be look into as the source of this oscillation. Perhaps I should try to figure out what frequencies are being injected during the CAL sweeps. ,"{'term': 'H1 CAL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",83417,anthony.sanchez@ligo.org

KisselI attach updated figures from the SPI Conceptual Design Document ( G2301177 ) slides on the the expected performance of the SPI w.r.t. the HAM2-HAM3 ISI system for the purposes of the Final Design Document ( T2400145 ). These ""final answer"" figures are attached as .pngs attached in L P Y order. For posterity I attach a .pdf which shows the entire plot series from the code (${SeiSVN}/seismic/Common/SPI/Scripts/ plot_spi_motivation_20250314.m ).""The code"" is an updated version of that from LHO:70306 . Really the only updates are to use the modern version of each of the SPI's DOF's noise budget most recently documented in LHO:12273 . Please revisit LHO:70306 if you'd like to understand the estimate of the ISI platforms that has not changed at all as we have not made substantial performance improvements to the HAM2 - HAM3 ISIs since (remember O4 started in June 2023 and is on-going today.) DISCUSSION A brief bit of discussion about the changes in SPI noise budget: SPI LONG : (See first .png or page 20 of the .pdf plot series)The modern modeled SPI longitudinal IFO performance is worse below 0.5 Hz where the model now includes a real estimate of the frequency noise of its laser source -- which is now the PSL (with frequency noise from LHO:73976 ) rather than what was proposed in the conceptual design phase an independent laser source with (0.01 * free-running NPRO frequency noise) = 1 [Hz/rtHz] * (100 [Hz] / f). For that same reason it's better above 0.5 Hz and the limit is instead the next noisiest source in the modern design -- ADC noise. SPI PIT/YAW : (See second .png and third .png or pages 9 and 15 of the .pdf plot series)The modern modeled SPI Pitch / Yaw optical lever performance is split into two curves: - one for spot size of 5 mm at the ""reflector"" ISI (i.e. the spot size at ""ISIJ"" which is HAM2 in this pathfinder instantiation after having diverged over the ~16 [m] traverse and measured by ""QPDA"") and - one for spot size of 1 mm at the ""transceiver"" ISI (i.e. the spot size at ""ISIK"" which is HAM3 in this pathfinder instantiation after having been refocused to the original transmitted size by the ~16 [m] ROC reflector on HAM2 and measured by ""QPDB"" on the HAM3 transceiver.)The CDD's model did not account for the spot size increase so it was essentially the 1 mm spot size model. The changes in 1 mm spot size model from CDD to FDD are (1) an updated [whitened] ADC noise curve showing an improvement below 0.3 Hz and (2) the addition of an estimate for the shot noise on the QPD which makes the >30 Hz performance slightly worse.Both the 1 mm and 5 mm modern estimates are limited by ADC noise across the entire frequency band. CONCLUSION My interpretation of the plots -- regardless of these changes to each DOF of the expected SPI performance comparing these against the estimate of the June 2023 performance of the HAM2-HAM3 ISI system the conclusions from the conceptual design remain: we still expect the pathfinder to provide a range of ""interesting"" (YAW) to ""delightful"" (PIT LONG) amount of improvement to the system more-so in some regions and less in others.

We ended up reverting this change since it introduced an offset into the cameras that we use in full lock - BS ETMs. We switch over to these cameras in the ADS_TO_CAMERAS state as one of the last things we do before low noise. Sheila's idea to implement these new camera offsets introduced by the new code is to switch to the new server after we get to almost full lock and then account for these offsets to bring us back to our previous position. In order to for this to work the position of the camera inputs would need to be consistent lock to lock otherwise we run the risk of adding in a manual offset to an odd place from that particular lock. Looking back at the last week or so we are very consistent before we switch to the camera servo ( attachment1 as example ). Next steps are to coordinate with CDS to try this during the tail end of maintenance day or another opportunity.

What we tried so far? We played with different combinations of ADF_VCXO phase and ADF demod phases to see if we can get linearity between these two channels however it did not work. (See Figure 1) We plotted parametric ADF_I and ADF_Q for various Demod phases. Ideally this curve should be an ellipse centered around (00). However the ellipse we got was shifted from (00). (Figure 2 part A). { The ellipticity of the ellipse depends on the amount of squeezing and the location on the ellipse determines the squeezing angle} What we did ? We calculated the required offsets (ADF_OFFSET_I and ADF_OFFSET_Q) so that the ellipse can be centered around zero. We calculated the G (4.5) value from the ellipse and used this normalization constant of ADF_Q to turn the ellipse into a circle. Calculated the new ADF readback of sqz angle values after numerically adjusting the offsets and normalization and verified that it indeed is linear over a wide range of squeezing angle. (It is matches well with squeezing angle see Figure 3 ) Added all these changes to the model and scanned the RF6 demod phase to verify that the ADF readback values now closely follow the squeezing angle. (see Figure 4) and Figure 5 shows the ADF_I and ADF_Q demod plot (Ideally it should be a circle ) We modified the SQZ_ANG_ADJUST.py (Fig 6): We found that the ADF_OMC_TRANS_SQZ_ANG = -95 for the optimum Squeezing and added it as the setpoint. The servo locked with these changes .

Currently proposed layout for POPX TT looks to have the AOI between 30 and 35 deg and an alternate proposal is somewhat larger than that but smaller than 45 deg.

Before and after the measurements the power of the beam impinging ZM1 was 293mW and 289mW respectively so I used 2.9e-1W as the input. AOI close to but not quite retro-reflection (our reference point) was estimated to be ~1.4deg by measuring the distance (~1+-1/8"") between the incoming and the reflected beam ~21"" away from the mirror surface: (1+-1/8)/21/2 * 180/pi = 1.4+-0.2 deg. (The reason why it's not set to zero+-0.2deg is because of silly mechanical interference we didn't bother to fix.) At 45.4deg AOI the beam might have been very close to the back of (or even getting clipped by) the adjustment screw for the eddy current damping magnet. I wasn't able to see the beam (1.7uW of blob is hard to see for anybody) so it's unclear. At least the beam position on the HR surface looked OK so if the beam is clipped by the adjustment screw it might be unnecessarily long. I'll have another look with IR sensitive camera on Monday.

We just got back into Observing after I took us out to touch up some sqz phases. This morning Camilla and Sheila had found ( 83350 ) that the SQZ servo was pulling the ADF phase away and causing large range drops. The same thing also happened the lock after that. When we first got to NOMINAL_LOW_NOISE I tried running SQZ ANG ADJUST to check if we were in a spot where the ADF phase would end up getting pulled away. At the location where the squeezing was best the ADF sqz angle was pretty good and the demod error was near 0 ( ndscope1 ). I didn't adjust anything because of this just went back into FDS and then into Observing. I planned on monitoring the ADF phase angle and then do these tests again once we were thermalized. Over the course of thermalization the same issue with the ADF phase was happening although luckily the servo wasn't taking the phase in circles like it had been doing the previous couple of locks ( ndscope2 ). Once we were thermalized I took us out of Observing and ran SQZ ANG ADJUST. From that I saw that the best location for the sqz phase was now very close to a turning point ( ndscope3 ). To move away from this location I adjusted SQZ-ADF_VCXO_PLL_PHASE from 25 down to 10 and then adjusted SQZ-ADF_OMC_TRANS_PHASE from -107 to -117 to get SQZ-CLF_REFL_RF6_PHASE_PHASEDEG to oscillate around 0. The yellow BLRMS looks a lot better now and our range has gone up by 10Mpc but my changes did make the purple BLRMS worse by a bit ( ndscope4 ndscope5 ).

An active measurement of the transfer function from DRIVEALIGN_L to MASTER out was 1 without the linearization and -0.757 with the linearization on. So I've changed the DRIVEALIGN gain to -1.3 in the ALS_DIFF guardian when the use_ESD_linearization is set to false. We tried this once and it stayed locked for a DARM gain of 400 but unlocked as the UIM boosts were turning on. We tried this again but it also didn't lock DIFF so it is now out of the guardian again. I looked at a few more of the past ALS DIFF locks both sucsesful and unsucsesful attempts we are saturating the ESD (either the DAC or the limiter in the linearization) in the first steps of locking DIFF. We do these steps quite slowly stepping the darm gain to 40 waiting for the DARM1 ramp time stepping it to 400 then waiting twice the ramp time then engaging the boosts for offloading to L1. I reduced the ramp time from 5 seconds to 2 seconds to make this go faster. This worked on the first locking attempt but that could be a coincidence. We will leave this in for a while so that we can compare how frequently we loose lock at LOCKING_ALS. In the last 7 days we've had 48 LOCKING_ALS locklosses and 19 locklosses from NLN so roughly 2.5 ALS locklosses per lock stretch.

There are 4 monitor chassis installed. CER1 monitors the L1-VDC-C1 rack. The monitor is installed at the top of the L1-VDC-C1 rack. If we add an additional supply rack in the corner station this monitor has open slots to monitor it. CER2 monitors the L1-VDC-C2 and L1-VDC-C3 racks. The monitor is installed at the top of L1-VDC-C3. CER3 monitors the L1-VDC-C4 and L1-VDC-C5 racks. The monitor is installed at the top of L1-VDC-C5 and the network switch that all the corner station monitors connect to is installed at the top of L1-VDC-C4 CER4 monitors the L1-VDC-C6 L1-VDC-C7 and L1-VDC-C8 racks. The monitor is installed at the top of L1-VDC-C6. Michael Thomas started the IOCs for me. Initially CER4 was not responding and outputting 0's for all measurements. I determined that the IP address had been misconfigured. After changing the IP address to the correct value the monitor started outputting viable data. There are a few anomolies in the monitors that I still need to investigate further but ran out of time SUS-C6A +18V (L1-VDC-C1) is reporting an incorrect voltage. This is likely an issue with the supply itself reporting a lower monitor voltage than actual. SEI-C1 +18V (L1-VDC-C3) reports an incorrect voltage when plugged. This is an issue with the supply reporting a lower monitor voltage than actual. Additionally when a cable is plugged into the monitor port it often trips the supply. Currently there is no cable attached to the monitor. PSL-C1 +24 (L1-VDC-C4) is reporting erroneous data. SEI-C6 (L1-VDC-C4) is reporting very low voltage near 0V. PSL-R2 +18V (L1-VDC-C5) is reporting erroneous data. CDS,"{'term': 'LLO Electrical', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",75691,josh.collins@ligo.org

So in addition to it saying kappa_TST is 1.01 we'll have a channel that multiplies by the pushed model N/ct for the TST stage and that will report 1.01 * 1.48e-12 = 1.49e-12 N/ct.These are not used in the calibration pipeline and are purely meant for easier trending across model updates.

During preventive maintenance today I inspected the system and found that the key in the controller was in the OFF position. This appears to have been caused by human error. A large black cable likely the laser’s power cable was in contact with the key. It is probable that when someone was working in the area and moved the cable its weight caused the key to shift to the OFF position. See the attached picture for reference. This information should be considered when investigating CO2Y laser tripping occurrences to differentiate between unknown failures and cases caused by external interference. Action Taken: I repositioned the cable so it no longer touches the key in the controller. However I need to return and properly secure it to prevent the cable's weight from causing it to shift again and make contact with the key.

48443,L1 ISC - Damping Phase compensation in PI servos,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=75620,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:44:51 -0500","The underlying reason why PI damping phase is non-stationary is because the mechanical mode frequencies drift due to laser absorption and external temperature transients. This frequency change on the scale of 1-2 Hz per lock and >5 Hz seasonally move the signal seen within very narrow bandpass filters found within ' SUS-PI_PROC_COMPUTE_MODE##_BP '. These filter banks have very steep phase response per Hz with both site's response at time of writing: 140 deg/Hz for H1 and 100 deg/Hz for L1. As you can imagine the thermal transient of a single lock stretch or a day night cycle will completely mess up a fixed phase control design. Compensating filter Phase In L1's SUS_PI guardian I put together a system that compensates the phase imparted by the BP filter. The requirement for this is that you know the frequency of the mechanical mode as well as possible. The stronger the SNR of the mechanical the easier it is to lock the PLL to it. The frequency filter for the oscillator feedback then controls the noise in the frequency at which the PLL operates. Having the lowest gain before the integrator possible will give the most stable frequency lock (it should be moving slowly realistically). In practice frequency resolution on the order of +/- 0.02 Hz (1 sigma) or better is achievable which translates to a phase error of about +/- 3 degrees in your controller. The reduction is phase error is realised by feeding the frequency into a mathematical function which describes the phase slope of the filter. For L1's 10 Hz wide filters it is as simple as: def BPFilterPhaseEst(frequencyFromZero): ''' The 10Hz wide band pass filters that the PI BP filters use (of the form cheby2(""BandPass""440middle-5middle+5)butter(""BandPass""6middle-5middle+5) ) have a roughly linear phase response in a +/- 2 Hz where the magnitude response is still ~1. (mag falls fast off past that) This function gives you the approximate phase at some offset from the centre. Returns ------- targetPhase: degrees shift accumulated from BP filter ''' Phase = -371 - frequencyFromZero * 105 return Phase Here BPFilterPhaseEst estimates the phase impact of the BP filter based on how far the frequency is from the middle of your filter in a simple linear fashion but you can get fancy with any arbitrary function. The code would have to reflect the state of the front end i.e. it needs to know the centre frequency of your BP is (stored in PLL centre frequency) so maintinence is required. The PLL centre frequency must be the same as the BP centre frequency at all times and only the singular mechanical mode of interest must be in that BP. This phase offset would simply need to be subtracted from the some damp_phase (""damp_phase"" in my config file) such that it compensates the phase added by the BP filter at that same frequency. Calculating the correct phase to damp with Obtaining this damp_phase is the tricky part. One would need to experimentally demonstrate a good damping phase and know the frequency of the mechanical mode relative to the centre of your BP filter at the time of demonstration. Then: damp_phase = np.mod(damp_phase_in_DAMP_FILTERS - BPFilterPhaseEst(freq_mech_mode - freq_BP_centre) 360) or damp_phase = np.mod(-1*damp_phase_in_PLL - BPFilterPhaseEst(freq_mech_mode - freq_BP_centre) 360) where BPFilterPhaseEst is a function describing the phase of your BP filter with the L1 example given earlier freq_mech_mode is the frequency of the mechanical mode at the time of demonstration freq_BP_centre is the central frequency of Band Pass filter damp_phase_in_DAMP_FILTERS is the phase you may have added in SUS-PI_PROC_COMPUTE_MODE##_DAMP (which work the same as violin damping phase change filters) damp_phase_in_PLL is the phase you would enter in the PLL's SUS-PI_PROC_COMPUTE_MODE##_PLL_PHASE because the logic on that is inverted ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ [Yes: positive phase == phase lag]. You can now populate your piconfig file with the damp_ phase and the correct phase with which the PI damping would operate at is for some mode: centralFrequency = ezca[f'SUS-PI_PROC_COMPUTE_MODE{mode}_PLL_SET_FREQ'] lockedFrequency = ezca[f'SUS-PI_PROC_COMPUTE_MODE{mode}_PLL_FREQ_MON'] BPPhase = BPFilterPhaseEst(lockedFrequency - centralFrequency) phase = piconfig.pi_list[mode][""damp_phase""] ezca[f'SUS-PI_PROC_COMPUTE_MODE{mode}_PLL_PHASE'] = -1*int(np.round(np.mod(phase-BPPhase360))) All the rest of the SUS_PI guardian code is fluff making sure PLL's work and managing gains and bias as well and monitoring code unrelated to damping.","{'term': 'L1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",75620,vladimir.bossilkov@ligo.org

This is consistent with a miscalibrated vertical sensor causing common-mode vertical motion to appear as roll. Spoiler-alert - Edgard just predicted this to be true and he thinks that sensor T1 is off by about 15%. He also thinks the right sensor is 15% smaller than the left. -update- fig 2- I've also added the Vertical-Pitch plot. Here again we see significant response of the vertical motion in the Pitch DOF. We can compare this with what Edgard finds. This will be a smaller difference becasue the the pitch sensors (T2 and T3 I think) are very close together (9 cm total separation see below).

One problem emerging was that the QPD (shown in this image) readout doers not give a number for how far from centre the QPD is in our lab setup (it uses an old LCD output box with a microcontroller we can't find the documentation for). Another is that the four PDs are best aligned away from the centre of the QPD. So after testing it may be neccessary to move the QPD for best alignment. This morning Siva and Mayank setup the readout for all 8 PDs and also added a polarising beamsplitte r between the PZT controlled mirror used for dithering the alignment to the array and the aperture on the array assembly input. This was to ensure the polarisation was not affecting the measurement. Mayank and I measured the AC and DC signals for all 8 PDs using a horizontal dither on the PZT controlled mirror before the polarising beamsplitter when: 1: the light was centered on the QPD and 2: when it was in the observed ' best alignment ' when the coupling from the dither to the PDs was mininimised. Changing the DC alignment is done with the pitch and yaw screws on the PZT mirror mount. After the first couple of measurements we tried to get a time when the laser was not in a noisy state this could be because it keeps running multi-mode or some pickup in the measurement cables - not sure so further investigation needed. It does seem possible to obtain a spot where all the 8 PDs are minimised in the top left-hand quadrant of the QPD for. We also repeated measurements 1 and 2 with a vertical dither on the PZT. This is the LCD screen when aligned at its best alignment on the PDs for vertical dither on the PZT mirror. This is the readout for PDs 1-4 and 5-8 at this position. This is the LCD screen when the input alignment is such that the QPD is centred. I have attached our data file references for the measurements and some photos. Keita also tuned the laser temperature control thermistor from a resistance of 10 kOhms to 9.602 kOhms which seems to stop the laser mode-hopping and becoming noisy. Siva has also hooked up a cable between the QPD and a different QPD readout box which we can get oscilloscope readouts from. More measurements to follow...

If we take the improvement in optical gain noted above and calculate the improvment in the optical gain ^2 ie. (g_f^2 - g_i^2)/ g_i^2 = 0.023 = 2.3 % And compare it to the gain in OMC throughput from this entry to the measurement after changing the OMC ASC offsets above (T_OMC_f - T_OMC_i)/ T_OMC_i = 0.020 = 2% Both methods show a similar improvement in the coupling to the OMC or alternatively decrease in the HAM 6 losses. Since we improved the alignment of the OMC it makes sense that the losses decrease and them agreeing validates our method of using darm offset steps to calculate OMC throughput and thus the loss in HAM 6. The optical gain must be squared as it changes with the square root of the power at the output (due to the DARM loop).

In fact the SUSpoint in reality and the calculation of the SUSpoint are done with a linear combination NOT a quadrature sum. This means that if you grab some data from the cart basis sensors take the ASDs (where you lose the phase) and add them in quadrature you will NOT get the ASD of the measured suspoint.

KisselOli and I are beginning the process for designing damping loops for the A+ O5 BBSS. We're running through the same process that I've been running through for over a decade designing suspension damping loops in which I build up a noise budget for the optic displacement in all DOFs using input noises for seismic noise DAC noise and OSEM sensor noise filtered through said damping loops all propagated thru the matlab dynamical model of the suspension. The first step along that journey is revisiting all the input noise sources and making sure we have good model for those. OSEM noise and DAC noise models have recently been validated and updated when I revisited the HLTS damping loop design (see LHO:65687 ).However I haven't worked on damping loops for suspensions suspended from a BSC-ISI since 2013 see G1300537 for the QUAD G1300561 for the BSFM and G1300621 for the TMTS.In those I used the 2015 update to the 2005 requirement curve from T1500122 as the input motion.Now after a decade worth of commissioning and improvements I figure it's time to show that work here and use it in modeling future SUS damping loops where the SUS is mounted from a BSC-ISI.One of the biggest things we've learned over the decades is that the seismic noise input to the suspension at its ""Suspension Point"" motion for a given suspension can be the (quadrature) sum of many of the ISI's cartesian degrees of freedom and depends on where and in what orientation it is on the optical table (see T1100617 ). As such we installed front-end infrastructure to calculate the calibrate the lowest stage sensors -- the GS13 inertial sensors -- into both the Cartesian and Euler basis (see E1600028 ). In this aLOG I do as I did for the HAM-ISI LHO:65639 I show the Cartesian contributions to each of the Beam Splitter's SUS point motion by multiplying the Cartesian channels by the coefficients in the CART2EUL matrix for the beam splitter .The time I used for this performance of the H1 ISI BS was 0.01 Hz binwidth (128 sec FFT) 10 average 50% overlap data set starting at 2025-03-19 14:00 UTC. - This was a late night local set with no wind and 0.1 [um_BLRMS] level microseism (between 0.1-0.3 Hz) - GND to ST1 Sensor correction is ON including the DIFF and COMM inputs. - Here at H1 the corner station does NOT have beam rotation sensors to improve the GND T240 sensor correction signal. But both end stations have a BRS. - The wind was low at this measurement time but it's worth saying that each end-stations wind fences are in dis-repair at the moment too be fixed soon. - ST1 Z drive to ST1 RZ T240 decoupling is ON with a ""pele_rz"" filter - Off diagonal ST1 dispalign matrices are in play X to RX & RY = -1e-4 & 1e-4 Y to RX = -7e-4 Z to RX & RY = 3.5e-3 & 2.5e-3 - ST1 Blend Filters: - X & Y = nol4cQuite_250 - Z = 45mHz_cps - RX & RY = Quite_250_cps - RZ = nol4cQuite_250. - As far as I can tell there's NO ST1 to ST2 sensor correction on the ST2 CPS nor is there and ST1 to ST2 FF to the ST2 actuators. - ST2 Blend Filters: - X & Y = 250mhz - Z = 250mhz - RX & RY = tilt_800b - RZ = 250mhzThese will be used to make updates to /ligo/svncommon/SusSVN/sus/trunk/Common/MatlabTools/ seisBSC.m or seisBSC2.m which are toy models of the BSC-ISI performance used so you don't have to carry around some giant .mat file of performance and you can per-interpolate on to an arbitrary frequency vector much like I did for seisHAM.m in CSWG:11236 .I've committed the .xmls and .pngs in the following SeiSVN directory: /ligo/svncommon/SeiSVN/seismic/BSC-ISI/H1/BS/Data/Spectra/Isolated/ ASD_20250319/ ISC SUS SYS ","{'term': 'H1 SEI', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",83470,jeffrey.kissel@ligo.org

KisselI've been tasked with using the analog voltage input to the OMC DCPD transimpedance amplifiers ( LHO:83466 ) to drive a sine wave around 10 kHz in order to try to replicate a recent PI ring up which apparently caused broad-band low frequency noise LHO:83335 .There is a remote excitation channel that typically drives the this analog input excitation path is running at 16 kHz: the H1:OMC-TEST_DCPD_EXC channel's filter module lives in the h1lsc.mdl model in a top_names OMC block at the top level of the model and the output of that filter bank is connected to the lsc0 IO chassis' DAC_0's 11th / 12th digital/analog channel. That DAC's AI channel goes through quite an adventure before arriving at the OMC whitening chassis input -- following D19000511 - AI chassis for lsc0 IO chassis DAC_0 lives in ISC-C1 U7 port OUT8-11 D9M spigot (page 2 component C15) connected to cable ISC_406 - The long ISC_406 DB9 cable connects to a LEMO Patch Panel ( D1201450 ) on the other end in ISC-R5 U12 (page 22 component C210). - Funky LEMO to D9M cable D2200106 ISC_444 connects from the patch panel to the whitening chassis - ISC_444 D9F end of the cable to lands at the J4 D9M port labeled ""From AI/DAC / Test Inputs"" of OMC DCPD whitening chassis in U24 of ISC-R5 rack.... but this won't work: this channel is driven at 16 kHz sampling frequency. So we can't drive anything technically above 8192 Hz but realistically above ~5-6 kHz.I digress.I'm going with SR785 excitation via DB9 breakout.Anyways -- I attach here an ASD of the OMC DCPDs sampled at 524 kHz during nominal low noise this morning (taking advantage of the live-only 524 kHz channels) low-passed at 1 Hz without any digital AA filters the channel H1:OMC-DCPD_524K_A1 filter banks channels from LHO:82686 . The OMC DCPD z:p=1:10 Hz whitening is ON during nominal low noise.The top panels show a zoomed in and zoomed out version of the DCPDA ASD calibrated into photocurrent on the PDs ( H1:OMC-DCPD_524K_A1_OUT channel * 0.001 [A/mA] all the rest of the calibration is built in to the front-end filter bank see OUT DTT Calibration ).The bottom panels show a zoomed in and zoomed out version of the DCPD ASD calibrated into ADC input voltage with what whitening that was ON divided out and the 2x ~11 kHz poles of the TIA divided out. ( H1:OMC-DCPD-524K_A1_IN channel * 1/4 [four-channel copy sum to avg conversion] * 0.0001526 [V/ct for 40 Vpp range over an 18 bit ADC] * z:p = (10):(1) inverse whitening filter * z:p = (11k10k):([]) inverse HF TIA response )In the zoomed in version of the plots you can clearly see the mess of acoustic modes at 10.4 kHz. One can also see relatively noise free region at 10.3 kHz that looks clean enough for me to target with my analog excitation.I plot the de-whitened ADC voltage because the transfer function between the TEST DAC input and the TIA's output voltage is designed to the 1.0 in the GW band from ~50 to 5 kHz given that in that band the transimpedance is 100e3 [V/A] and the series resistor that turns the voltage injection of the TEST input into current is 100e3 [V/A] (see ). So ""nominally"" un-whitened ADC counts should be a one-to-one map to DAC voltage input. At 10 kHz however the 2x ~11 kHz poles of the TIA which drop the TEST input voltage by a factor of 5x at 10 kHz (see e.g. plots from LHO:78372 )So that's why in the lower panels of the above mentioned plot of OMC DCPD A's ADC voltage calibrated in the way mentioned above. This should be a one-to-one map to the equivalent DAC voltage to drive.I looks like the non-rung-up 10.4 kHz PI modes today were of-order 1e-2 V = 10 mV and the surrounding noise floor is around 1e-5 V = 10uV = 0.01 mV of equivalent DAC drive. The lower limit of the SR785 SRC amplitude is 0.1 mVp = 0.2 mVpp (single ended). Also using the SR785 in a FFT measurement mode where you can drive the source at a single frequency there is no ramp. It's just ON and/or OFF.(I should also say that a SR DS340 function generator also doesn't have a ramp on its output. I considered using that too.)So -- hopefully suddenly turning on a noisy 10.3 kHz line at 0.1 mVp into the IFO with a noise floor of 0.01 mV/rtHz at 10kHz won't cause problems but ...

I then quickly pulled up an Ndscope to find that Ryan and company had lost lock and not returned back to NLN[600]. Other alogs that mention NLN_ETMY all mention locklosses. so that was our last well documented path out of NLN_ETMY. There was some confidence building amongst the wealth of knowledge within the Control Room that we should manuel from NLN_ETMY[710] to BACK_TO_ETMX[561]. Since that was the intuition and consensus of the room full of knowledgable people we tried it.

KisselRecall there is an analog TEST voltage input to the OMC DCPD in-vacuum transimpedance amplifier TIA ( D2000592 ) whose in-air interface is through the OMC DCPD Whitening Chassis' ( D2200215 ) J4 D9M port labeled ""From AI/DAC / Test Inputs."" This whitening chassis lives in U24 of ISC-R5 by HAM6. port. This port usually connected to a DAC via cable ISC_444 and the DAC channels can be used to test the response of the TIA / Whitening / AA / ADC chain entirely remotely.However these test inputs are not always engaged and functional they are governed by analog relay switches. These relay switches themselves are governed by digital binary input generated by the Beckhoff slow-controls system.This is aLOG is about how to find and use these relay switches.It's been a while since I used this screen (July 2023 LHO:71225 ) and it looked different than I remember and can't find an aLOG about the change so I document it here.See attached screenshot .What's shown as ""A_Relayset & B_Relayset"" are the settings channels H1:OMC-DCPD_A_RELAYSET and H1:OMC-DCPD_B_RELAYSET .Setting these to ""On"" or ""1.0"" turns ON the relay enabling the test input excitation.Setting these to ""Off"" or ""0.0"" turns OFF the relay disabling the test input excitation.In the screenshot the A channel relayset is called out with a deep purple arrow.What's shown as ""A_Relaytoggle"" & ""B_Relaytoggle"" are momentary channels H1:OMC-DCPD_A_RELAYTOGGLE and H1:OMC-DCPD_B_RELAYTOGGLE .These are momentary channels that if set to ""On"" or ""1.0"" it toggles the RELAYSET to the opposite setting it's currently in and then self-restores to ""Off"" or ""0.0."" So on the screen hitting ""On"" changes the relay state and hitting ""Off"" does nothing.In the screenshot the A channel relaytoggle is called out with a dark green arrow.Note -- there is only one differential test input from the J4 D9M ""From AI/DAC"" port of the whitening chassis. So if you turn on BOTH A and B test input relays it drives BOTH A and B's test inputs simultaneously with signal identical to the input. If you want or only need to drive one DCPD's TIA path at time then turn on only that corresponding relay.CAL ","{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",83466,jeffrey.kissel@ligo.org

We then watched the ASD and confirmed that given the number of averages it took to percieve a gradual ring-down at those frequencies (over 20 averages of for each at 0.02BW assuming a Q-Factor of ~1000 which is conservative) that the readout was indeed mechanical and that these were indeed our Bounce and Roll modes.

We had tried this the previous week but ran into locking issues with h1asc's use of this camera's centroid values and so had to move this along with the ITM cameras back to h1digivideo2. The plan was to just move one camera h1cam26 to the new server and make the gain changes on h1asc's camera centering to compensate for the new video IOC as was done when the ETM cameras were moved last year. It became quickly apparent that the centroid values were more noisy with the new code in addition to being offset (plot shows CAM26_X new code on left old code on right). We suspect the issue may be due image masking. The old code applied an image mask before calculating the centroids the new code takes the image as a whole. The image snapshot shows that the edge of the optic is visible to the right an issue the ETM images do not have. We reverted CAM26 back to the old server at 17:00 PDT. ,"{'term': 'H1 CDS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",83448,david.barker@ligo.org

48559,L1 PEM - 980Hz noise was coming from HAM1 HEPI,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=75738,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Sat, 22 Mar 2025 13:57:29 -0500",L. Dartez A. EfflerI'd previously reported that the HAM2 accelerometers see the most motion ( LLO:75694 ). Trying better understand what might be causing this noise we decided to check the HEPI piers as well. The HEPI piers also see the 980Hz motion (see L1_ham123_piers.pdf . Moreover the HAM1 HEPIs (particularly piers 1 and 4 which share a beam ) picked up the same motion an order of magnitude more strongly than those on HAM2. It's not straightforward to determine what caused things to ring at 980Hz (especially since the noise hasn't returned since last week ). We thought to check the DAC channels out to the HEPI actuators but they aren't DQ'd. I trended the overflow accumulators but didn't see anything there so it doesn't look like we're saturating at the DACs.It's worth noting that the accelerometers see a bunch of junk manifesting as a forest of lines when the noise is present. See ham2_acc_prm.png . The HEPI ISO input channels see some of this junk too (see ham_iso_in1.png ). I was only to look below 450Hz because the DQd channels are only sampled at 1kHz. The ISO input signals are upstream of the in-loop control filters and the HEPI plant. I'm attaching a screenshot of the HEPI isolation control filter (with plant included) because we had trouble finding this earlier today (see ham1_iso_x_foton_with_plant.png ). I'm also included a screenshot of the filterbank I got the filter and plant from: ham1_iso_x_filterbank.png . I used the plant filter in FM5.In conclusion: We're convinced that the source of the noise is at HAM1. We're not sure what it is though and it'll be very difficult to hone in on the problem now that the noise is gone.References------------ aLIGO BSC-ISI HAM-ISI and HEPI Basis and Naming Conventions PEM Non-image files attached to this report L1_ham123_piers.pdf ,"{'term': 'L1 PEM', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",75738,louis.dartez@ligo.org

Madeline L. and Jon F. @ Caltech.The test goal was to operate the replacement actuator and controller (together) so we could verify the system behavior before it is swapped into GV-11. Test procedure https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-E2500063 was used with a few modifications of test order to complete the tests more efficiently. We also decided to modify one test (upper limit switch test) to avoid any chance of over-compression damage to the bellows. We eliminated additional clutch tests to avoid brinnelling of the clutch disk but will discuss with the group on Monday if we should still do the test (it’s quick). Summary of tests:•Software release: Drive has latest release v. 6 which is archived in DCC.•Phase rotation: Phase rotation of the motor is correct.•Limit switch test: Optical limit switches stop the motion under all conditions.•Encoder vs limit switch operation: Both operating modes were successfully demonstrated. •Limit switch behavior and position: Limit switch trip resets the position data (as designed).•Encoder behavior: SSI absolute encoder limits work as designed. No position errors seen entire range tested. •Encoder vs limit switch hierarchy: Limit switches have highest priority overrule encoder (as designed).•Power fail recovery: Drive system maintains position data after e-stop or mains failure. A small change position after power fail testing is normal as motor armature cannot stop instantly. Ramp down error ~ a few hundredths of an inch but gate position is maintained in drive non-volatile memory.•Brake test: Brake resists 600 inch-lb torque of emergency clutch (either direction). Brake rating is 1200 in-lb torque.•Following errors: The drive faults and stops (as designed) and applies the brake if motor rotation and encoder positions do not track. Note: Following errors due to belt breakage/slip should also trip brake but were not tested. We were able to create a logic issue when operating in an unusual manual jog mode which we will have the manufacturer investigate. This was the only unexpected behavior we have seen with the system.•Clutch behavior: The overload clutch unlocks and relocks reliably. With the bearing system redesign there should be no repeat of the GV-11 lock ring failure even if the carriage hits an upper or lower stop. There is some worry that if the clutch opens the carriage weight will overwhelm the clutch. This drive should sense this and if not already following error tripped (and brake applied) the dv/dt sense should also apply the brake. •Automatic Operation/Manual operation/Teach/Reset functionality: All panels operate correctly. HMI (touch panel) operation is stable.•Logic race: HMI vs Unidrive. Current release of drive software v.6 fixed this error no recurrence seen after multiple e-stop and power fail tests. This was also verified in 2018.•Test instructions for future reference: currently being updated and will be archived in DCC. •CDS sensors: The CDS gate position sensors operate correctly. These are independent sensors attached to the ball screw cover but are not associated with the drive system. These sensors restore automatic CDS valve position annunciation to the control screen.•Reestablish discussions with vendor set up PO if consultation required: PO in place original design engineer is still with the company and Scott and Carson have been in contact.• Operator refresh: Scott and team ran this drive in every possible mode/direction/switch location they are now the experts!

Except for 2 fine boards the rest were tesed ok. One board has small <1Hz noise and the other board has >1Hz noise. Replacing these 2 fine boards with our 2 spare all the noise are now looks ok and comparable to each other. See figure 3 . Picture 1 : The setup later got put under a thermal enclosure. Sensors and boards were originally tested in pair. The boards are SN 22755-22752-22759 (coarse) and 22468-22471-22469 (fine) Figure 2 : ASD (with calibration) when testing indivitually (Jim recommented plugging one sensor in at a time) and when testing all at once. Both shows problems with SN 22471 and 22469. Swapping cable around and noise follows the boards not the sensors. bottom plot is the electronic noise at the CPS field box with no module installed. Figure 3 : ASD (with calibration) after swapping 2 boards with spare (22471 -> 38497 22469 -> 38693). Looks ok. So far all the sensors seem fine to be install for the HAM1 ISI retrofit. The new board (if use) may need a bit offset adjustment because boards give different readouts for same sensor gap. I will retest all of these after installing on the ISI later. ,"{'term': 'X2 SEI', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",75735,huyen.pham@ligo.org

However it seems that doesn't have much impact on the SQZ angle readback and this servo should work fine with changes in SRC detuning. The first subplot shows the ADF ellipse and then the channels after the normalization that is used to turn it into a circle these look the same for the two offsets. The next plot shows the readback of the SQZ angle which is arctan2 of the normalized signals from the first plot.

Based on the loss estimates from 83457 I've set the Injection loss to 0.178 (17.8% loss) and the PD efficiency (readout efficiency) to 0.815 and the phase noise to 0. The third attachment shows the model where I've manually adjusted the SRC detuning to roughly match the subtracted squeezing and the second shows a linear fit of SRCL offset to these detunings. This suggests that the SRCL offset should be at -306 counts to reduce the SRCL offset and that we are currently running with a SRCL detuning of 0.013 radians. ,"{'term': 'H1 SQZ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",83572,sheila.dwyer@ligo.org

48655,H1 SEI - Comparison Between Coherent and Incoherent Sums to generate H1SUSBS SusPoint Euler Motion from H1ISIBS,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=83556,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 15:52:48 -0700","J. Kissel O. Patane B. LantzAfter seeing my post of the current (2025-03-19) performance of the H1ISIBS in LHO:83470 Brian -- in his LHO:83473 comment -- rightly cautioned Oli to beware the difference between (1) a ""statistical"" or ""incoherent"" model of the CART2EUL projection to the suspension point where . one takes the ASDs of the CART DOFs (which are inherently only containing amplitude information no phase relation between channels) . multiplies them by the CART2EUL coefficients and . takes the quadrature sum to form an ASD model of the euler basis motion vs. (2) a ""linear combination"" or ""coherent"" model of the CART2EUL project to the suspension point where . the time-series of each CART DOF are multiplied by the CART2EUL coefficients . the time-series are then coherently summed (where ""coherently"" summed just means the amplitude AND phase relationship between the channels has been preserved) and . then an ASD is taken of that to form an ASD model of the euler basis motion. He states - ""if the DOFs are independent (which maybe they are and maybe they are not) then using the quadruture sum of the ASDs (1) is a reasonable thing to do."" and - ""I think this difference [between (1) and (2)] not going to impact any of your calculations""I'd not seen a comparison of these two models either at all or in a long time every chamber + SUS combination is different and I had the data so I made the comparison.I'll discuss the 6 Euler Basis plots in reverse-traditional order because they're easiest to understand progressively that way. YAW This plot is uninteresting because the BS projection matrix from CART to EUL has only one unity element mapping RZ directly to Yaw. However it lets me introduce what I'll be plotting.In the upper panel this shows the both models of ASDs and the underlying Cartesian components multiplied by the CART2EUL matrix element. As expected here the thick black dashed ASD -- the coherent sum (2) model -- is identical to that think magenta dashed ASD -- the incoherent sum model (2).The lower panel is the ASD ratio of the linear sum (2) divided by the incoherent sum (1).Of course for this DOF the two models are identical so this ASD ratio is identically 1.0 across the whole frequency band.With me so far? Good. :-P PITCH Here because the Beam Splitter suspension is mounted in the center of the ISI BS optical table yaw'd 45 degrees RX and RY map to PITCH via sqrt(2) with the same sign.But the RX and RY performance of the ISI BS is slightly different so the ratio between (2) and (1) is interesting .Most notably around the HEPI cross-beam foot resonance (traditionally called the ""HEPI Pier resonance"" prior to 2014 see LHO:13505 ) -- the broad feature at ~7 Hz -- where the ASD ratio shows that the incoherent sum model (1) under predicts Sus. Point displacement by a factor of ~1.35x w.r.t. the coherent sum model (2).And then at some other feature at ~17 Hz the incoherent sum model (1) is over predicting the Sus. Point displacement by ~(1/0.8) = 1.25x. ROLL OK now flip the sign of the contribution of RY and watch the coherent sum drop -- fascinating! The contribution of that same ~7 Hz feature is now dramatically over-predicted by the incoherent sum by a factor of ~(1/0.4) = 2.5x. Are these two the inverse of each other? No! I don't show it explicitly but comparing (2)/(1) for roll (the inverse of what's plotted) and (1)/(2) for pitch the 7 Hz number is 0.74x and 0.52x respectively so markedly different! VERTICAL Now we're getting really interesting -- for vertical Z is mapped one-to-one but RX and RY are contributing in opposite sign and with only *roughly* the same magnitude [m/rad] CART2EUL coefficient.The incoherent sum (1) is overestimating the vertical displacement by as much as a factor of ~(1/0.2) = 5x where the vertical motion is limited by RX and RY between 0.5 and 3 Hz.Wow!I won't look type thru the rest of the plot because the plot describes it best but boy is it more interesting than I thought it would be. TRANSVERSE With transverse even though this degree of freedom ""doesn't matter"" for the beam splitter now we're cooking with 5 contributing Cartesian degrees of freedom and except for RZ they're all contributing at interesting levels.Again you reading the plot is more useful than me describing it here but it's quite interesting that the linear sum (2) predicts more motion between 0.6 Hz and 3.5 Hz and the incoherent sum (1) predicts more motion overestimates the motion between 3.5 to 15 Hz. LONGITUDINAL Finally the DOF we work the hardest on shows contribution from all 5 Cartesian degrees of freedom. A lucky-coincidence perhaps but it looks like the models are about the same for most of the frequency region and the incoherent sum (1) is over-predicting the displacement between 3.5 to 15 Hz which is re-enforcing Brian's comment. WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN? Brian is again definitely right to call out that the linear sum (1) model is a better model of the displacement of the Sus. Point than the incoherent sum.But both I (and perhaps even he) definitely wasn't expecting factors of 2x discrepancy let alone factors of 5x.So I think I might make Brian's conclusion from LHO:83473 a little stronger -- the difference between models will impact the calculations of the Bigger Beam Splitter Suspension (BBSS) performance so for the update to the seismic input motion I'll *not* just update the performance from the ~2005 seisBSC.m estimate to the current 2025 real *cartesian* performance incoherently projected to the Sus Point but instead update it to the current 2025 real *euler* Sus.

I went into init to try another initial alignment but ALSY got into the same state. Upon further investigaiton this was due to the ALS Guardian detecting an error in the locking relating to the ALS_Y_LASER_IR_DC.

She suggested instead of running a 3rd Initial Alignment run PRMI again and then do a MANUAL Initial Alignment for SRC OFFLOADED. I should say I let PRMI complete then took ISC LOCK to DOWN selected MANUAL INITIAL ALIGNMENT then for ALIGN IFO selected SRC ALIGN OFFLOADED. This actually took (2) attempts the first one went to DOWN (not sure why). After the 2nd attempt was successful started over with locking! DRMi locking once again looked the same. Symptoms: hard to see misalignment in flashes POP90+18 look ok (NOT seeing anything for SRCL (or MICH) TRIG MON FAST---it is zero). POP90+18 do start with what looks like a lock but then they slowly drift back down to 0 within 1-second. Going to try another MANUAL INITIAL ALIGNMENT but this time doing trying: (1) AS CENTERING OFFLOADED then (2) SRC ALIGN OFFLOADED. Once again see that for OFFLOAD SRC ASC signals were not very far off at all 2nd time in a row 1st attempt at SRC ALIGN OFFLOADED went down due to AS_A_DC slowly drifting down. Although SRC looks like it's decently aligned I can assume it's bad and misalign SRM and then do tweaks of SR2 to center on the PD AS_AS_C. then realigned SRM and tweaked it to make highs higher/lows lower for ASC-AS_C_NSUM_OUT16.

Have went through 2-Initial Alignments as well as several successful PRMIs and CHECK MICH FRINGES. DRMI Symptoms : DRMI would start out the first few seconds with strong flashes seen on the camera and decent flashes on ndscopes but Then the behavior would switch to an ugly camera image which would be seen as DRMI looking like it's going to catch but within 1-sec POP18+90 (and also the camera) would ""wobble"" back down to zero in a ""slow flash"". (It feels like DRMI has been like this over the weekend as well but after some of these wobbles to zero after these ""slow flashes"" DRMI would lock. Not the case tonight---have had zero DRMI locks going on 6+hrs.) It feels like the alignment is decent and no environmental issues but it doesn't seem to trigger or start LSC control when these flashes start (hence their ""slow"" drop of POP18+90.). What's Been Tried : Initial Alignments (have gone through 2). Manual Alignment : This was the first suggestion Sheila gave me. After PRMI completed took ISC LOCK to DOWN went to MANUAL Alignment and then on ALIGN IFO selected SRC ALIGN OFFLOADED. Tried this a few times. Also tried AS CENTERING OFFLOADED followed by SRC ALIGN OFFLOADED. For all of these ASC was not far off---leading one to think alignment was fine. Checked pointing on AS_C photodetector with SR2 (no real change made here) & also used SRM to make highs higher/lows lower (no change here either). NEXT Try Improving DRMI triggering : Increasing gain of H1:LSC-POPAIR_B_RF18_I (&Q) _GAIN from 2 to 4 (see attached screenshot with appropriate screens) Sheila mentioned this helped with a similar issue 3 weeks ago (see alog83182 ) I went to the POPAIR RF 18 medm and changed the gains for both I & Q gains from 2 to 4 while ISC_LOCK was trying to lock Green Arms. Then opened up the LSC SDF which had the safe.snap file up (and then did a sort for this substring: H1:LSC-POPAIR_B_RF18_) and then I ACCEPTED this safe.snap with the new gains of 4 for both of these channels. Now: We Wait Just before Sheila and I were going to go with this new gain a M6.7 EQ rolled through (of course).

The details of the proposed sensor rejiggling is a bit involved but the basic idea is that the part of the M1-to-M1 transfer function coming from the mechanical plant should be reciprocal (up to the impedances of the ISI). I tried to symmetrize the measured plant by changing the gains of the OSEMs then later by including the possibility that the OSEMs might be seeing off-axis motion. Three figures and three findings below: 0) Finding 1: The reciprocity only allows us to find the relative calibrations of the OSEMs so all of the results below are scaled to the units where the scale of the T1 OSEM is 1. If we want absolute calibrations we will have to use an independent measurement like the ISI-->M1 transfer functions. This will be important when we analyze the results below. 1) Figure 1: shows the full 6x6 M1-->M1 transfer function matrix between all of the DOFs in the Euler basis of PR3. The rows represent the output DOF and the columns represent thr input DOF. The dashed lines represent the transpose of the transfer function in question for easier comparison. The transfer matrix is not reciprocal. 2) Finding 2: The diagonal correction (relative to T1) is given by: T1 T2 T3 LF RT SD 1 0 0 0 0 0 T1 0 0.89 0 0 0 0 T2 0 0 0.84 0 0 0 T3 0 0 0 0.86 0 0 LF 0 0 0 0 1 0 RT 0 0 0 0 0 0.84 SD This shows the 14% difference between RT and LF that Brian saw (leading to L-Y coupling in the ISI-to-M1 transfer functions) This also shows the 10-16% difference between T2/T3 and T1 that leads to the V-R coupling that Brian posted in the comment above. Since we normalized by T1 the most likely explanation for the discrepancies is that T1 and RT are both 14% ish low compared to the other 4 sensors. 3) Figure 2: shows the 6x6 M1-->M1 transfer function matrix after applying the scaling factors. The main difference is in the Length-to-Yaw and the Vertical-to-Roll degrees of freedom as mentioned before. Note that the rescaling was made only to make the responses more symmetric the decoupling of the dofs a welcome bonus. 4) Finding 3: We can go one step further and allow the sensors to be sensitive to other directions. In this case the matrix below is mathematically moving the sensors to where the actuators are in an attempt to collocate them as much as possible. T1 T2 T3 LF RT SD 1 0.03 0.03 -0.001 -0.006 0.038 T1 0.085 0.807 0.042 0.005 0.006 0.006 T2 0.096 0.077 0.723 0.013 0.002 0.03 T3 -0.036 0.025 -0.02 0.696 0.012 0.006 LF -0.004 -0.018 0.045 0.016 0.809 -0.004 RT -0.035 0.026 0.02 0.004 -0.008 0.815 SD I haven't yet found a good interpretation for these numbers beyond the idea that they mean the sensors and actuators are not collocated. Three reasons come to mind: a) The flags and the magnets are a bit off from each other and we are able to pick it up the difference. b) The OSEMs are sensing sideways motion of the flag. c) The actuators are pushing (or torquing) the suspension in other ways than their intended direction. The interesting observation comes when observing Figure 3 . After we apply this correction to the sensor side of the transfer function we see a dramatic change in the symmetry and the amplitude of the transfer matrix. Particularly the Transverse degree of freedom is much less coupled to both Vertical and Longitudinal. Similarly the Pitch to Vertical also improves a bit. This is to say by trying to make the plant more reciprocal we also end up decoupling the degrees of freedom. We can conclude that there's either miscollocation of the sensor/actuator parts of the OSEM or more likely that the OSEMs are reading side motions of the flag because we are able to better see the decoupled plant by just assuming this miscalibration. I will post more analysis in the Euler basis later.

Relocking after that was simple but after again losing lock about an hour later H1 has not been able to relock since then. I'll write up a separate and more detailed entry later but most of the struggle with relocking stemmed from an issue I started noticing with ALS-Y that would cause spontaneous locklosses at states after LOCKING_ARMS_GREEN. At seemingly random intervals the ALS-Y PLL would jump from its Locked state into Ramp Gain which flags the PLL as ""not okay"" causing Guardian to assume a lockloss. Since I don't know what causes this state transition I'm not sure what the underlying issue might be but so far when this happens the first thing I can see changing is this FIBR_LOCK_STATE. Eventually these glitches stopped late in the afternoon. An example of one of these instances (in this case during FIND_IR) is shown in the ndscope screenshot attached. 15:30 - Dropped observing for commissioning 17:09 - Lockloss from commissioning activities 18:44 - Observing straightforward relock without an alignment 19:54 - Lockloss - alog83533 ALS-Y issues begin locking proves impossible 20:57 - Jim power cycling HAM3 CPS rack to address noise - alog83528 22:52 - ALS-Y issues seem to have stopped but can't lock DRMI so starting initial alignment 23:13 - IA finished LOG: Start Time System Name Location Lazer_Haz Task Time End 19:57 SAF LASER HAZARD LVEA YES LVEA IS LASER HAZARD 20:34 15:22 FAC Nellie MY N Technical cleaning 15:48 15:58 FAC Kim MX N Technical cleaning 16:46 16:30 FAC Tyler X-arm N Tumbleweed inventory 16:44 17:06 CAL Jeff LVEA - OMC DCPD measurement 17:16 17:17 AOS Jason Opt Lab N Inventory 17:36 18:26 ISC Mayank Jennie Opt Lab Local ISS array work 00:24 18:45 FAC Tyler CR N Swapping EX fans 18:47 19:26 VAC Janos EX MER N Looking for parts 19:43 19:52 VAC Travis EY MER N Measurement 20:09 20:06 SAF Tony LVEA - Transition to SAFE 20:34 21:02 CAL Tony PCal Lab Local Measurement to prepare 21:37 ","{'term': 'LHO General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",83536,ryan.short@ligo.org

48677,H1 SQZ - nlg sweep with IFO: 67% total efficiency for squeezing,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=83457,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:05:44 -0700",I'm starting to look at the nice data set Camilla took with different non linear gains in the interferometer 83370 . A few weeks ago we took a similar dataset on the homodyne see 83040 . OPO threshold and NLG measurements by both methods now make sense: Based on the important realization in 83032 that we previously had pump depletion while we were measuring NLG by injecting a seed beam we reduced the seed power for these two more recent datasets. This means that we can rely on the NLG measurements to fit the OPO threshold and not have the OPO threshold as a free parameter in this dataset. (In the homodyne dataset I had the OPO threshold as a free parameter and it fit the NLG data well. With the IFO data we want to fit more parameters so it's nice to be able to fit the threshold independently.). The first attachment shows a plot of nonlinear gain measured two ways from Camilla's table in 83370. The first method of NLG calculation is the one we normally use at LHO where we measure the amplified seed while scanning the seed PZT and then block the green and scan the OPO to measure the unamplified seed level (blue dots in 1st attachment). The second method is to measure the amplified and deamplified seed while the seed PZT is scanning (max and min) and nlg = {[1+sqrt(amplified./deamplified)]/2}^2 (orange pluses in attached plot). The fit amplified/ unamplified method gives a threshold of 158.1uW OPO transmitted power in this case while the amplified/ deamplified method gives 157/5uW. Mean squeezing lump and estimate of eta: The second attachment here shows all the spectra that Camilla saved in 83370. As she mentioned there there is something strange happening in the mean squeezing spectra from 300-400 Hz which is probably due to the ADF at 322Hz was on while the LO loop was unlocked. In the future it would be nice to turn off the ADF when we do mean squeezing so that we don't see this. This could also be adding noise at low frequencies making the mean squeezing measurement confusing. Mean squeezing is injecting squeezing with the LO loop unlocked which means that it averages over the squeezing angles and if we know the nonlinear gain (the generated squeezing) the mean squeezing level is determined only by the total efficiency. With x = sqrt(P/P_thresh) Rp = 1 + 4*x*eta / ((1-x)**2) Rm = 1 - 4*x*eta / ((1+x)**2) R_mean = (Rp + Rm)/2 x_factor = 2*x*(1/(1-x)**2-1/(1+x)**2) eta = (R_mean-1)/x_factor Despite the confusing effects that might be from the ADF below 400 Hz these estimates of total efficiency are all in good agreement with each other at high frequency and they do suggest a slight frequency dependence to the total efficiency. Above 1kHz these suggest a total effiicency from 64-67%. Fitting squeezing and anti-squeezing. I chose two high frequency bands that seem to be free of technical noise and estimated the squeezing anti-squeezing and mean squeezing levels for each and used them separately to fit for OPO threshold total efficiency and phase noise see plot . This is without doing any subtraction of non quantum noise. The two frequency bands agree well with each other with a threshold of 158uW a total efficiency of 67% and basically no phase noise. Loss Budgeting: Tallying up the losses from the google sheet we have 83% total efficiency expected if we also include the 6% of unexpected losses seen on the homodyne (which is probably due to crystal losses) this leaves us with an additional 14% unexplained losses related to the squeezing injection into the IFO. opo_esc= 0.985 SFIs = 0.99**3 FC_WFS = 0.99 ZM456 = 0.99 OFI = 0.99*0.995 SRC_loss = 0.99 OM1 = 0.9993 OM3 = 0.985 OMC_QPD = 0.9904 OMC = 0.956 QE = 0.98 This is a larger loss estimate than in 82097 where the estimated total efficency was 72% where we had to infer the nonlinear gain. With this total efficiency of 67% if we were to reduce the losses in HAM7 by 6% by moving the crytsal we would see an improvement at high frequency from 4.6 dB to 5.1 dB if we keep the OPO trans at 80uW. We can also use this data set to look at how much technical noise is limiting our squeezing. However we can already see that since the mean squeezing and the anti-squeezing agree very well with this level of loss which explains our squeezing very well at high frequencies it seems that phase noise and non-quantum noise like noise from the CLF is not an important limit to our high frequency squeezing. Another thing to note about this data set is how obvious the SRCL detuning is at the high NLG squeezing measurement.

From a quick analysis we can list some differences that have been found: We see in Figure 1 that more glitches are revealed in the 10-20 Hz range on days with high micro-seismic motion after the switch to NOLINES (as suggested by alogs 69850 and 69626 ). The two days in this figure were selected with micro-seismic motion above 1000 nm/s. This increase is related to the subtraction of the calibration lines in NOLINES channel. This same behavior is present on days with low micro-seismic motion to a lesser extent as presented in Figure 2 . The two days were selected with microseismic motion around 600 nm/s. Additionally there are glitches bunched up between 30 and 60 Hz. This is clearly visible when looking at 40 and 60 Hz ( Figure 3 ). The glitches around 40 Hz with large SNR seem to be related to the blip and tomte classes besides some extremely loud ones. We are investigating whether or not this is a seasonal feature of these classes. Another interesting thing to note is that we can see a large amount of high frequency glitches present before the change that are not present after ( Figure 4 ). We are investigating whether or not this was a coincedence. More details can be found in the slides . Further investigations are ongoing.

It started around 1pm for 2.5hrs then disappeared for 1.5hrs before reappearing and staying until this morning. IFO stayed locked with this noise. I didn't see the same noise in the ground sensor or HEPI. This noise seems to move from 1.4Hz to 1.8Hz as time passed. See figure 1 . We're down this morning for maintenance and after taking a closer look my suspcision is the L4C H2 sensor (has this feature the highest in sensor spectra). Can't detect this noise with no control (ISI offline) because it gets too noisy broadband. With ST1 controlled I checked the L4C response and the feature is also highest in H2 see figure 2 . I've also checked the problematic GS13 H3 on this chamber ( alog 63339 ). It is still bad the same way and the digital fix is still working as expected. See figure 3 - reference traces = fix off live traces = fix on. During the attempt to find/fix the noise I accidently tripped the ETMX ST1 twice and that got rid of the noise?? which very L4C-like thing see figure 1 again. We'll monitor and continue hunting if the noise is back.

The motivation is to eventually calculate the change in the phase of these paths that will occur with the upcoming HAM1 work (see T2500040 for more details). Although we believe we should be able to re-phase these signals from scratch I still thought it worth obtaining this information in case it can speed up the process. I plan to put the data into a google spreadsheet that I’ll eventually share here. Even though I thought this was a fairly non-impactful measurement we did have some issues locking DRMI yesterday which were due to a loss of the LSC REFL 45MHz signals. I resolved the issue by loosening the SMA connector of the REFL 45MHz into the WFS demodulator chassis and then re-tightening with a little less torque. In the attached plots you can see the REFL 45 error signals (3rd and 4th plots) return after I did this (first time cursor). I am concerned that such a small change in torque could have this effect I will ask the electrical engineers and see if we need to investigate further. ,"{'term': 'L1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",75814,adam.mullavey@ligo.org

EDIT 3/26/35 MEZ: INSERTED TEST #7 REACTION TIME AFTER ANALYZING VIDEO TLDR: At default speed (25%) and acceleration (10%) we replicated the anomalous behavior seen on 18 March: for brief ""Jog"" commands of less than about 3 seconds the drive starts and then runs on by itself even after the ""Jog"" button is released. Although the clutch slips as the brake release is disconnected the drive did not fault as it should have (due to lack of encoder rotation). This time we waited 10 full seconds just to be sure it wouldn't change its mind. We then manually interrupted the upper limit switch at which point the drive halted and threw a fault (as it should). We then repeated the test for normal ""GOTO OPEN"" commands and for longer ""Jog"" presses (> 3 seconds). In these cases the motor ran for about 7 seconds the clutch popped twice (indicating between 1 and 2 full revolutions) and the drive faulted showing Error 41 and Following Error. This is the correct reaction but we think the reaction time is not acceptable. We then repeated the tests with Speed and Acceleration set to 100%. In this case the motor only ran briefly (about 2.5 seconds from video frames) before the drive faulted. The clutch popped only once in each case. This is closer to the behavior we want. We theorize that the controller firmware may inadvertently include a race condition that renders it blind to both user inputs and encoder/drive faults that arrive during motor acceleration. Jon is reviewing these findings with the drive vendor. We elected to leave the actuator on the test stand and hooked up in case the vendor supplies updated firmware or requests additional diagnostic tests (it is impractical to continue testing once it's ported to the cleanroom). We also found 2 new bugs (likely unrelated): - At one point the ""GOTO OPEN"" command in the ""OPERATE"" mode appeared to trigger a parameter adjustment dialogue. This was not repeatable. - With the Travel Limits method set to ""Encoder"" (the normal setting) the drive refused to jog upward. Jogging downward still worked. Both worked if as a workaround the travel limits method was instead set to ""Limits"" (so as to only obey limit switches and ignore stored encoder limits). These issues are also being reviewed with the drive vendor. TEST LOG: Brake release is electrically isolated by disconnecting wire at terminal block (shaft is immobilized). Gate pin interlock is still bypassed. Actuator starting position is ~ mid-range. Test 1: Speed 25% acceleration 10% ""Limits"" = limit switches. Push ""Jog up"" for ~ 3-4 sec --> drive starts and stops when button is released. Drive fault 41. Reset error. Test 2: Speed 25% accel 105 ""Limits"" = encoder mode. Push ""Jog up"" for 2 seconds and release --> drive starts rotating and continues on its own after button is released no fault displayed --> after waiting 10 seconds Harry interrupts top limit switch beam manually . Drive stops --> HMI shows ""Following error"" and then immediately ""Drive fault 41."" Error cleared HMI reset. Test 3: Speed 25% accel 10% ""Limits"" = encoder. In ""Operate"" screen push ""GOTO OPEN"" --> Drive rotates 7 seconds about 2 revolutions (2 audible detent clicks on clutch) then halts on its own. --> ""Following error"" and ""Drive fault 40."" Error cleared HMI reset. Test 4: same as Test 3 but holding Jog Up instead of GOTO --> Drive rotates 7 sec about 2 revs (2 audible clicks on clutch ~ same as Test 3) then halts on its own. --> ""Following error"" and ""Drive fault 40."" Error cleared HMI reset. Test 5: Speed 100% accel 10% ""Limits"" = encoder in ""Operate"" mode push ""GOTO OPEN"" --> Drive rotates 7 sec about 2 revs (2 audible clicks on clutch ~ same as Test 3) then halts on its own. Test 6: Speed 100% accel 100% ""Limits"" = encoder in Operate mode push ""GOTO OPEN"" --> Throws dialog ""Are you sure you want to change the stored position?"" Unclear what happened here did it slip into ""Setup"" mode? Notes unclear. Repeat. Test 7: Speed 100% accel 100% ""Limits"" = encoder in Operate mode push ""GOTO OPEN"" --> Drive rotates 2.5 seconds about 1.25 revolutions (from video) 1 audible click from clutch and then halts on its own. BETTER. Test 8: Speed 100% accel 100% ""Limits"" = encoder in SETUP mode retry 2 second Jog UP ( like Test 2 but full speed/full accel ) --> NEW PROBLEM: HMI shows operating all green but nothing happens. --> HOWEVER: Pushing ""Jog DOWN"" does operate AND drive faults immediately (as in Test 7). --> Jog works both directions (and faults immediately) if ""Limits"" mode is set to ""Limits"" (which means optical limit switches rather than encoder value govern max. travel). Test 9: Check if repeat ""Down"" jog after fault else same as above still works --> Same as above Jog Down operates and faults immediately.

I had done this work a while ago convinced myself it is not due to cross coupling with DC3 but never posted. These ring-ups seem to be happening much less frequently over the last couple of months. In the past there had been attempts to add suspension compensation to the AS port Centring loops. Here I'm looking at DC3. I measured the DC3 P and Y loops with a broadband measurement capturing roughly 0.1 Hz up to 2.5 Hz. I attempt to also build a loop model to compare against. DC3 is a loop with two mirrors as controllers (OM1 and OM2) also feeding back to OM3 however this does not affect the loop as the sensor is AS_A which is in transmission of OM3. To build a loop model I: Obtained models for the suspension responses: OM1 has a measurement with damping ON measured in the Sus SVN on 2022-06-06. I fit this response as a ZPK transfer function. OM2 had no such measurement. I obtained a suspension model of it and extracted the necessary damped transfer functions from the simulink model to something I can use in python in a method we utilise in calibration for the QUAD models. I'll note this here: OM2 is the dominant actuator by a factor of 3.5 in Pitch and 12 Yaw. So for the model to match measurements [ spoiler they don't ] the OM2 model better be damn accurate. I use normalised models of each such that the DC gain can be set relative to it's response to AS_A discuessed below. Measured the response of OM{12}_{PY} to AS_A_{PITYAW} at 0.5 Hz to see relative angular contribution of each mirror. This is obtainable from a ray propagation model as well so if I ever make one for the AS port I have some references. Fetched the ASC OUTPUT MATRIX values that run in LOW_NOISE as these change when we're down. I put the gains as they are in LOW_NOISE for my single bounce measurements. Multiplied in the respective DC3 filterbanks but not the LOCK bank gains because that is where I measure the relative angular contribtion from so those gains are already taken into account. Attempted to gain match the measurements of the full loop between 0.1 and 0.5 Hz which are relatively free of suspension dynamics. Using python control library and navigating its' minefield of precision error traps I build my model with the two parallel control mirrors. Here is how they stack up: DC3_P: Model and measurement Due to the mixture of dynamics between somewhat comparable actuators it is hard to say much. I have no measurement of the OM2 dynamics at time of writing trusting model. So I'd guess the OM2 model is innacurate. In-lock when we measure step-response commissioners have inferred a response time that is faster than pictured (i.e. gain higher) with UGF likely closer to 0.05 Hz. I dont know where this extra gain would be coming from. Extra gain would put the un-compensated suspension dynamics very close to creating new UGFs at 1.36 Hz. DC3_Y: Model and measurement This one is most dominated by OM2 it is pretty clear that the responant Yaw mode is at the wrong frequency and should be higher Q. Anyway as interesting as this is we probably still don't need to stress about the uncompensated dynamics unless we want to increase the gain of these loops. And there does't appear to be any direct action at all near 2.7 Hz unless the beam on AS_A is pitching at 1.36 Hz and causing yaw clipping at the top and bottom stroke which could up convert to my frequency of interest.

The CPS Timing Fanout Chassis is the problem and it got replaced with spare. I swapped back in the original master board (module) for corner 1 so corner 13 are still the same as before. First board on corner 2 (ST1_H2) was bad and got swapped out. Few CPS boards in spare pile didn't work. * After doing more troubleshooting I found that the ITMX ports on CPS Timing Fanout Chassis D1400155 (S1400611) was bad not the synch cable. This chassis then got replaced with spare S1400604. The bad chassis and the CPS field box S2000236 (that probably triggered this whole situation) will be sent to the electronics lab for inspection/repair. Note that while changing out the chassis I accidently turned the key on the Y TCS laser controller chassis. I then consulted with Karla and put it back to correct state: Enable with Gate On. * After timing chassis is back online the corner 1 and 3 signals got noisy. It turned out that the corner 1 master board (13443) we swapped in last night is very noisy with synch cable alive and connected and since both corner 1 and 3 boards got synchronized to it all CPS's on these 2 corner were noisy. I swapped back in the original master board. * After the master board signal got fixed corner 2 ST1_H2 CPS signal were found dead. The CPS board 13626 slave 0 got replaced by board 13227 to fix this issue the readout changed within 100 counts. Two boards in the spare pile did not work when I tried to use them (board SNs: 15911 31214-new). These board including the 13443 will be tested in Hi-Bay test stand before officially claiming them broken. The ITMX ISI is now back to normal and the performance is comparible with other BSC ISI's. see figure . About the glitch problem I will continue monitor now that we changed both CPS timing chassis and the CPS ST1 H2 board on corner 2.

We discovered the ground cable on the old board (D1001474) was loose and came off and decided to try a new board. Upon connecting the new board (D1900397) we lost the signal from all of the CPS(123) boards at ITMX. Upon rebooting everything and investigating it appears that in connecting the new board the sync cable which connects to CPS2 from the master CPS1 box became non functional and the Master CPS board was replaced with a Backup Salve board. We recovered signals from CPS1 and CPS3. Upon closer inspection of the old CPS2 board all of the ground pins are connected and we can attach the loose cable to another attachment point. So in the end we're using the same hardware (except the Master CPS1 board) as when we started but the sync cable is toast (this may have been the underlying problem all along).

Brian and I thought of a better way of getting the M1 OSEMs in PR3 calibrated relative to the HAM2 GS13s: Use the ISI drives in L T V for frequencies above the suspension resonances to get an absolute calibration. We can use the measurements Jeff took in LHO alog 80863 and project them in the OSEM basis then use the translational (Longitudinal Transverse Vertical) drives to calibrate the OSEMs. Since the GS13s are calibrated to [m] all of the transfer functions (shown in the first attachment) are in [OSEM meters]/[GS13 meters]. At high frequencies (sufficiently above the resonances) the OSEMs should just be measuring (-1)*ISI motion because the suspension is isolated. The calibration error will depend on how well we are able to drive LTV from the ISI without cross-coupling to any other DOF. Figure 1 attached shows the 6x6 transfer matrix between the ISI drives and OSEMs (inputs are columns and outputs are rows). We highlight the 6 translational transfer functions that can be used to calibrate the OSEMs in red. The drives seem decoupled enough to do the calibration (for example we expect to see a length drive only in LF and RT no motion anywhere else). Figures 23 and 4 show a detail of the 6 transfer functions we will use for calibration all of them should be scaled to 1 [OSEM m]/[GS13 m]. The scalings are: T1 T2 T3 LF RT SD 1.544 0 0 0 0 0 T1 0 1.394 0 0 0 0 T2 0 0 1.273 0 0 0 T3 0 0 0 1.411 0 0 LF 0 0 0 0 1.588 0 RT 0 0 0 0 0 1.366 SD Two things to note: 1) The relative calibrations are consistent with the ~15% mismatch that led to the V to R and the L to Y couplings that Brian and I observed in the comments of LHO alog 83200. 2) The absolute calibrations being in the ballpark of 1.5 seem large but they are close to the calibration factor in plotHLTS_ISI_dtttfs_M1.m that transforms between [um/drive cts] to [m/N]. The transfer functions plotted always seem about a factor of 1.5 off from the MATLAB model. Maybe there's a connection that explains why the calibration factor seems so large. Figure 5 shows all of the diagonal ISI to M1 transfer functions after applying the calibration factors. They all asymptote to 1 at high frequencies even though we only used L T and V for calibration. A good sign that we're on the right track. Figure 6 shows the effect of the calibration on the M1 to M1 transfer matrix (inputs are columns and outputs are rows). The solid Black trace is the corrected M1 to M1 the dashed lines show what it was before the sensor calibration. A few of the cross couplings become significantly better: [L-Y] [V-P-R] are the best performing. I think this gets enough benefit for the ISI - SUS estimatior. It also might be worth trying this scheme in other suspensions where we would benefit from eliminating more cross terms in the OSEM transfer matrix.

In short they're looking at the 4-channel SUM of each DCPD's 4x analog copies of the voltage going into the the ADC in units of 4x ADC counts.In the attached trend I divide these by 4 (or scale by 0.25) to compare against the saturation limit of a single ADC channel which is what we really want.Remember this the General Standards Low Noise Fast ADC which spreads its 40 Vpp input range across 18 bits so the saturation limit is +/-2^17 = +/- 131072 [ADC ct].In the trend I highlight when we engaged the relays (without any SR785 excitation on) and when we turned them off to show how loud that is. We did *not* break lock from those glitches but it sure made the ETMX actuators sad for a bit and caused a big glitch in the detector.I also highlight the period over which we increase the amplitude of our excitation from 0.1 to 250 [mVpk_SE SR785 SRC Output].Our excitation doesn't start to show up as contributing to this ADC channel MIN/MAX time-series until we hit excitation amplitude of 50 [mVpk_SE SR785 SRC Output]. It reaches at most 40k [ADC ct] = 6.1 [Vpp_DIFF ADC Input] (again of 40 Vpp_DIFF so 15% of the range) at our loudest excitation amplitude of 250 [mVpk_SE SR785 SRC Output].I also attach the same OMC DCPDA photocurrent ASD in the main entry but I add what the DCPD photo current ASD looks like under lesser excitation amplitudes 10 mVpk in BLACK 50 mVpk in ORANGE and the one I've already shown 250 mVpk (again in BLUE ).Again the 250 [mVpk SRC Output] excitation is a factor of 5x above the amplitude that this PI mode was at the time of the low frequency broadband noise.Sheila reminds me that we've seen PIs *louder* than this time and *not* seen any broadband low-frequency noise increase.But anyways even at 50 [mVpk_SE SR785 SRC Output] -- which according to this ASD (a) The equivalent to a photocurrent of 4.07e-7 [A/rtHz] at 10.3 kHz (b) Comparable to the height of 4.04e-7 [A/rtHz] at 10.428 kHz (for a 0.1 Hz frequency resolution which DTT turns into an 8 sec FFT or 1/8 = 0.125 Hz resolution and Hann window ENBW = 0.187)-- this starts to dominate the ADC's RMS since there is a noticeable change in the WINDOW MAX/MIN channels.But it's a small fraction of the ADC range.I note that the OMC DCPD analog whitening was ON at all times during our measurements today and during each of the old data sets. So that means at these frequencies there's an extra gain of 10x on the TIA output voltage. ,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",83596,jeffrey.kissel@ligo.org

We see a decrease of the detuned SRC spring frequency from 7.343 Hz to 2.191 Hz. I am attaching each sensing model generated by pydarm. Second attachment ( 20250322T190652Z_sensing_mcmc_compare ) is for the measurement done last Saturday third attachment ( 20250327T160138Z_sensing_mcmc_compare ) for the measurement done today. We trust the model because the fit (orange trace) and the data (green dots) match well above the 10 Hz fit range. Additionally the data on both measurements below 10 Hz shows a similar behavior. This gives us (1) confidence that the change in the sensing function was indeed from SRCL detuning and (2) we may have other sources of coupling into the sensing function -- thinking about DHARD as the main culprit. The first attachment ( sensing_ratio ) shows the relative change of each measurement labeled by their report id. We see that the latest calibration measurements (orange and black) have been consistent with the latest front-end calibration (blue) -- more confidence towards SRCL changing the sensing function. While this improves the detuning of the interferometer the overhead to update the calibration has deemed to high for the few days left that will be running. We will reassess when we are close to coming back into observing mode (June) What I did to make plots: (1) Get the report from the calibration measurement this morning: In the terminal -- no need to activate any environments or configuring the terminal in any way -- running pydarm report will create a report of the latest measurement that was done. This command will not change FE calibration so for now this is a safe way to get data and manipulate/evaluate it. (2) Used script to retrieve sensing function measurements from calibration reports: The script located at /ligo/home/francisco.llamas/CAL/sensing_function/20250326_plot_sensing_measurements/compare_measurements.py will load the measurements as provided by their report id. I personally chose a dictionary to add comments for labeling purposes. The function 'sensing' will load the measurement and get the response. The rest is plotting aesthetics.

Kissel S. DwyerSheila and I were finally able to use an SR785 by HAM6 ISC-R5 (see setup and discussions in LHO:83523 LHO:83466 and LHO:83468 ) to inject a loud sinusoidal excitation into the OMC DCPD transimpedance amplifier TEST inputs via analog interface of the OMC DPCD whitening chassis. Remember this is in hopes to mimic a PI ring-up and identify whether or not this would cause ~10-100 Hz broadband noise increase in the detector sensitivity as was seen on 2025-03-12 ( LHO:83335 ). We saw NO broadband low frequency noise increase with an excitation amplitude that results in a factor of 5x *higher* photocurrent on the DCPDs than during the PI ring-up. I attach a four-panel plot and because that makes each panel small I also attach the same plots zoomed in to each panel.In the plots I'm comparing four different times: - ( RED ) 2025-03-12 17:32 UTC -- the time of the 10.4 kHz PI mode ring-up from LHO:83335 - ( BLUE ) 2025-03-20 16:13 UTC -- the time I used in LHO:83468 to assess how much drive I should be able to put in - ( GREEN ) 2025-03-27 17:16 UTC -- a time during the loudest 250 [mVpk_SE SR785 SRC output] excitation - ( BROWN ) 2025-03-27 17:30 UTC -- just after we're done with our tests and everything is unplugged in the nominal configurationUpper panels of 1st Attachment (zoomed in with 2nd and 4nd attachment)-- the 65 kHz version of the OMC DPCD A channel that has NO digital anti-aliasing (under the obfuscated channel name H1:OMC-PI_DCPD_64KHZ_AHF_DQ ) calibrated into photocurrent on DCPDA (which needs only a conversion of 0.001 [A/mA]). - Left panel (and 2nd attachment) is zoomed in around the 10.2 - 10.5 kHz region showing the excitation The acoustic mode forest and except for the unthermalized data the 02 (or 20) optical mode hump. - Right panel (and 4th attachment) is the full ASD across the 10 Hz - 25 kHz frequency range.Lower panels of 1st Attachment (zoomed in with 3rd and 5th attachments) -- GDS-CALIB_STRAIN converted to DARM displacement (which needs only a multiplication by the length of the arms L = 3995 [m]). - Left panel (and 3rd attachment) zooms in on the 10-100 Hz frequency region and - Right panel (and 5th attachment) shows the whole 10 - 7000 Hz sensitivity.There's NO change between BLUE (excitation OFF) and RED (excitation ON) and thus no evidence of broadband noise increase we saw in BROWN (during PI ring-up).%%%%Measurement notes- For no particular reason we turned on BOTH DCPDA and DCPDB test excitation relays (see LHO:83466 for how). That means our single-ended qqq [mVpk] analog excitation from the SR785 converted to qqq [mVpk] differential by the SR785 Accessory Box (whose TF is 1 [V_DIFF] / 1 [V_SE]) was driving that qqq [mVpk] amplitude into BOTH A & B channels' TEST inputs within the TIA. So the excitation seen in OMC DCPDA's ADC input is also in DCPDB and thus the sum of the the two OMC_DCPD_SUM the DARM error signal actually sees twice this amplitude. But the sum is done digitally after down-converting to 16 kHz so it's not relevant to ""is the ADC getting saturated"" discussions just important to bring up in ""how much of this excitation can the IFO handle"" discussions.

Lockloss analysis can be found at 1427407500 . No error messages were displayed on the DIAG_MAIN screen so the guardian proceeded with relocking the IFO. During this process I received a call from Huyen who wanted to run a test to check a digital fix for the 1.4–1.8 Hz noise seen on the ETMX SEI (see alog 75872 for more details). After Huyen completed the ETMX SEI test the guardian attempted to relock the IFO but the ALS Y PLL had trouble locking. To troubleshoot I trended the crystal frequency and manually set it to its last known good value (~118 MHz) ensuring the PZT frequency fluctuated around 0. This allowed the PLL to lock enabling the slow frequency servo to maintain lock and the guardian was able to proceed with lock acquisition. The IFO reached LOW NOISE at 23:59 UTC without further issues after the ALS Y PLL stabilized. However the transition to OBSERVE was blocked due to the SQZ being stuck at Waiting for FC_locked preventing frequency-dependent squeezing. Checking the FCGS_REFL camera I noticed the beam was significantly misaligned. I corrected this by adjusting FC1 alignment primarily in pitch from -117.2 to -132.2 which helped lock the SQZ_FC . During this process Begum contacted me regarding low SGH GR DC power (103.4 mW) which was making it difficult for the FC to lock. We adjusted the SGH GR temperature to increase power and meet the locking threshold. While making these adjustments the IFO successfully transitioned to OBSERVING mode at 00:22 UTC . While in OBSERVING we noticed that the SGH GR rejected power was too high posing a potential risk to the fiber. We adjusted the HWP and QWP reducing the rejected power from 0.652 mW to 0.064 mW bringing it to a safer level. The IFO remains in OBSERVING mode.

Further I have noticed that the glitches appear only when there is high microseismic ground motion along with the 12 Hz noise seen in the HEPI sensors. The blue trace in the second image is from a time when the 12 Hz peak was there in the HEPI sensor but the microseismic ground motion was low and the glitches are not there. The black trace in the second image is from a day with high microseism but the 12 Hz peak was not there in the HEPI sensors during that time and the glitches were absent. The red trace is from a time when the microseism was high and the HEPI sensors had the 12 Hz peak and this is when the glitches appeared.

For future reference the ISP 1000 rotation is CCW. I removed the Labjack from having any control of the valves the Labjack is still in the panel and can be used for CDS read backs if wanted at a later date. I separated the ISP 1000 safety valve power from the pump starter and installed new Start/Stop buttons for the valve. The valve will not open if the ISP 1000's are not running. Cleaned up pump power cables and safety valve cables. Relabeled the front panel buttons to make it more clear what each one controlled. With Harry present we check the full functionality of the panel: Both ISP 1000's are controlled by the same Start/Stop buttons. If one pump stops the other will turn off as well. This will also cause the ISP 1000 safety valve to close if opened. ISP 1000 safety valve will not open if the ISP 1000 pumps are not running. The ISP 250 pump works as intended and its safety valve can not open if the pump is not running. If the pump stops the valve will close. The Turbo pump valve can not be opened unless either the ISP 1000's or the ISP 250 pump is running with their respective safety valves open.

Jorge Issac Huyen] Today we wrapped up the HAM1 ISI retrofit in preparation for HAM1 ISI installation in April. We finished installing all the items except for TMD and the upper part of vertical CPS stop V2 which will be installed in chamber. Below is the detail. L4Cs. Spectra (GS13 & L4C) looks ok. Figure 1 . Dampers - flexure GS 13 and spring tips dampers were installed. I did B&K measurements before and after spring dampers were on. Results are in figure 2 - 450Hz and 154Hz modes got damped but the 145 Hz mode is higher. I've tried to changing the clamp force on the viton but this doesn't change. The TMD is coming from LHO and will be installed in chamber. CPS vertical stops corner 134 got installed. Bracket for corner 2 got modified ( alog 75716) and will be installed in chamer CPS installed - more details on CPS testing is in alog 75735 . See figure 3 for current spectra. We set the CPS gap according to the aLIGO CPS reference taken before swapping. This will likely be reset after the installation into chamber. Cables were routed according to D1002884 which we had to swap out H2 actuator cable (S2000586-70in - reported in alog 66135 ) to a longer one (S2000597-95in) to reach D5 flange. Lifting blocks trolley blocks and lifting chain were installed. Below are S/N for sensors got retrofitted in this ISI: Corner H1 H2 H3 V1 V2 V3 CPS probe 22755 22752 22759 22468 22471 22469 L4C 222 143 40 211 207 213 We also prep ISI with the C3 cover exposing the lifting chain/ trolleys - ready to lift once can open in the LVEA.

There were a lot of noise once the sensors were installed on the ISI so it is hard to tell if V2 paired board 12557 is bad as on the test bench. Some weight were added to the ISI but it doesn't seem to help to reduce this noise. With corner 1&2 on first field rack and corner 3 on the 2nd field rack it is not so obvious.

I just looked closer at it and saw that for the FINE SCAN when it sweeps the crystal frequency over it's defined range at the extremes of that scan the frequency comparator gives nonsensical values likely because the beat-note signal is too small. This corrupts the fit and sends the crystal frequency to the wrong spot. As such I've narrowed the range from +/- 100 to +/- 40MHz. The changes have been loaded but I made this change jsut before the IFO reached low noise so it hasn't been tested properly yet but I fairly confident it will be ok.

49201,H1 AOS - FARO LVEA Setup and Alignment (WP 11757),https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=83685,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 16:34:06 -0700","R. Crouch J. Oberling M. Robinson T. Guidry T. O'Hanlon Incoming wall of text but here's the short short version: Over the past ~15 months during available Tuesday maintenance windows we have been working the FARO around the LVEA setting alignment nests so we have the ability to drop the FARO almost anywhere in the LVEA and have it aligned to the local LVEA coordinate system. I'm happy to report that after working through and around unavoidable delays (mostly the emergency vent for OFI repair and the PSL frequency noise issues from the latter half of 2024 as well as several maintenance periods where IAS personnel were unavailable due to other required maintenance work) this effort is finally complete. There are now 53 bright red Spherically-Mounted Retroflector (SMR) nests around the LVEA and a number around the frame of the high-bay rollup door and the nearby wall these nests have been aligned to the LVEA local coordinate system. The naming scheme is F-CSXXX: F for FARO CS for the building (Corner Station in this case) and XXX is the monument number. As a brief reminder of where things were left before we started moving the FARO around the LVEA we had found what appeared to be a good alignment to our West Bay alignment monuments (BTVE-1 PSI-1 PSI-2 PSI-6 and height marks 901 902 and 903 (for z-axis alignment only)). We had found multiple errors in z-axis coordinates for the 4 alignment monuments eventually having to perform a water tube level survey of the BSC2 door flanges to re-establish our Z=0 then propagate that measurement to our alignment monuments to establish accurate z-axis coordinates w.r.t. WBSC2. Alogs from that work for some ""light"" reading: 75669 75771 75974 76889 and 77216 . Jumping the X-arm Beam Tube Our main challenge with this effort was moving the FARO to the other side of the X-arm beam tube (BT). Our most readily-accesible alignment monuments for the FARO are all in the West Bay with no access back to these monuments once we had moved to the outside of the BT this simple fact makes an accurate device move for the FARO very difficult (a device move is most accurate when we can shoot a mixture of nests at the new position and at the previous position(s) ). We had set several nests along the wall near the X-arm BT to assist in making the move as well as using existing nests along the frame of the High-Bay rollup door but still our position errors for the device move were >0.5 mm. TJ O'Hanlon was visiting in June 2024 and we brainstormed several methods to tighten up this positional uncertainty. Ultimately we decided to place temporary nests on the BTs themselves to aid in the initial and final device moves (temporary because as soon as we vent the nests move with the vacuum system and don't necessarily return to the same spot once the vertex is back under vacuum). We set 4 nests along the top of the X-arm BT 6 nests along the top of the Y-arm BT and a single lonely nest on the bottom of the Y-arm BT the Y-arm BT nests we to allow us to close the circle once we moved from the input arm area back into the West Bay. At this point we were interrupted for some PSL work (PMC swap early July) the vertex vent for the OFI repair (July - August) and then the PSL frequency noise issues (late-September to December). We were finally able to restart this effort in mid-December 2024 and test our ""new"" method for jumping the BT. And it worked! Our first positional uncertainty was <0.1 mm so we began setting alignment nests and moving the FARO around the LVEA. Moving Around the LVEA We started in the High-Bay area setting nests as needed and moving to the next position to set more nests then moving to the next position to set more... You get the idea. Our route took us around the outside of the LVEA. Starting in the High-Bay area we proceeded down the +X side of the output arm (WHAM 5/6) and back up the -X side towards WHAM3 then down the -Y side of the input arm around the PSL enclosure and then back up the +Y side and finally back in the West Bay to tie back into our original nests and apply the alignment to the LVEA local coordinate system. The issue here is the FARO really likes a large volume for accurate device moves and this is something we definitely do not have along the outside edge of the LVEA (this is also where most IAS work takes place). We are essentially moving down a series of hallways the hallways being the narrow walking areas between the vacuum chambers and the LVEA walls. These narrow corridors restrict the volume we can use for setting nests which means device position errors begin stacking up as we continue to move around the LVEA. In addition due to the vacuum equipment restricting line of sight we quickly lose sight of nests at previous device positions which in turn causes position errors to begin stacking up for most of our trip around the LVEA we only had sight to the device position immediately preceding the current one and nothing further back. This is unfortunately unavoidable due to the physical layout of the LVEA. In an ideal world we would be able to do all of this with an empty LVEA but that's not possible so we deal with what we have. PolyWorks can estimate the device position error so the 1st attached picture shows the results after we completed our circuit around the LVEA and tied back into our initial monuments in the West Bay. Ignore the Pass/Fail under the Test column I didn't change PolyWorks' default of 0.25 mm and we don't really have a metric for this right now the important thing here is the value in the Uncertainty column. PolyWorks uses a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate device position uncertainty defaults to 100 simulations per device position these results are given as 2 standard deviations (PolyWorks default) for each position from the instrument origin. This means that ~95% of the device's calculated positions from the simulations are within the listed uncertainty. Position 1 is our starting point by WBSC4 (old H2 BS chamber) with a view of our temporary nests on the X and Y BT as well as the nests on the wall across the X BT and the High-Bay rollup door frame position 2 is our jump over the X-arm BT positions 3 through 6 are down the output arm and back up the other side to WHAM3 positions 7 through 10 are down the input arm around the PSL enclosure and back up the +Y side position 11 is the final position we used before moving back into the West Bay near the TCSy table (with a view of the monuments we placed on the Y-arm BT) position 12 is back in the West Bay close to the biergarten and positions 13 and 14 are near the mechanical test stand by the West wall of the LVEA (14 is a repeat of 13 to account for device drift after sitting overnight). As can be seen the estimated positional uncertainty grows as we move down the ""hallways"" of the output and input arms with the worst uncertainty at the positions furthest from our starting point (positions 7-10 around the input arm). At this time I'm not sure we can do much better given the constraints of the physical layout of the LVEA we spoke with LLO at the last IAS meeting and they reported seeing similar numbers in their LVEA circuit. With the LVEA circuit complete we moved back into the West Bay to grab the last nests there that couldn't see from our initial position and to align to the LVEA local coordinate system. Aligning to the LVEA Local Coordinate System Back in the West Bay we collected the last of the red nests for FARO alignment and our alignment monuments (BTVE-1 PSI-1 PSI-2 PSI-6 and height marks 901 902 and 903). We used the 5"" sphere fit rod to grab BTVE-1 and the PSI monuments. We replaced the magnetic nests we had been using for the 3 height marks with glue nests and glued them down. Using an autolevel and a scale we measured the difference between where the nest ended up and where the height marks were (since the glue sets fast we couldn't sight the nests in directly inline with the height marks): Nest z-axis position w.r.t. height mark 901: +0.5 mm 902: -1.7 mm 903: -0.5 mm As done back in April 2024 (alog 77216) we used the z-axis coordinate for the BTVE and PSI monuments that had been corrected for the depth of the punch in the monument (since the sphere fit rod measures to the point at the base of the rod which sits in the punch and not the monument surface) and that had been corrected by our water tube level survey of WBSC2. We used BTVE and the 3 PSI monuments to get a rough XYZ alignment (again not using PSI-6 for z-axis alignment since we do not trust its z-axis coordinate). This rough alignment was then used to capture X and Y coordinates for the nests at the height marks then the height marks were used to enhance the z-axis alignment (not used for X and Y). The results of this alignment are shown in the 2nd attached picture for ease of comparison I've included the alignment results from April 2024 see the 3rd attached picture. This alignment is similar to the one we had back in April 2024 with a couple of differences that at first glance look large. The X and Y coordinates for height marks 901 902 and 903 deviate by large amounts compared to what we had measured with our rough BTVE/PSI only alignment which was not the case in our April 2024 alignment. But if you look closely you see that the measured components for the height marks in both alignments (March 2025 and April 2024) are very similar this is what is important. We don't really care about the X and Y coordinates for the 3 height marks as we aren't using them in the alignment and they were only captured using a rough alignment to begin with. The fact the measured components are matching fairly well lends some confidence to this alignment. The difference between the 2 that has the most potential impact is in the measured z-axis coordinates of the BTVE/PSI monuments. These z-axis coordinates are all roughly a factor of 2 worse in the March 2025 alignment vs the April 2024 one. In addition the alignment statistics on the left side of the screenshot are all better in the April 2024 alignment. The only explanation I have for this is in April 2024 we were working in the West Bay and only the West Bay while here and now we moved the tracker all over the LVEA thereby carrying around some positional error in the device that wasn't present in the April 2024 alignment. The only way to really test this alignment is to measure some monuments/features in the LVEA with known coordinates and see how they match. The upcoming pre-deinstall FARO shots to the WHAM1 passive stack will be a good test of this alignment. Another good monument to look at would be BTVE-5 over by the X-arm termination slab (by the cryopump/OpLev area). As another test since we haven't exactly trusted the repeatability of the sphere fit rod in the past we tried using points for PSI-1 and PSI-2 and applying the alignment using those we still had to use the sphere fit rod on BTVE-1 due to its dome shape and on PSI-6 due to it sitting inside an electronics rack in the biergarten (the bottom rail of the rack blocks direct line of sight to the monument but the 5"" sphere fit rod clears the top of it). The results of this are shown in the 4th attached picture. Right away it's clear this alignment is not as good as the one shown in the 2nd picture. The statistics are all worse and the match between measured coordinates is worse as well. This one gets discarded and we move ahead with the previous alignment using sphere fit rods for the BTVE/PSI monuments. Next we tested importing our move device targets into a blank PolyWorks file and aligning to them. Global Target Test PolyWorks allows you to import global targets from a text file. In PolyWorks a global target is one whose position is precisely known and does not change. Now that we've applied our alignment to our list of device position targets we have [XYZ] coordinates in the LVEA local coordinate system for all of them. These coordinates can be exported into an Excel spreadsheet and formatted into a text file for import into a future PolyWorks project. We did a test of this using a duplicate of our working PolyWorks project to keep from accidentally modifying our working project file. The format for the text file is 4 columns: X position Y position Z position monument name. The file can have no headers (PolyWorks gets mad if there are headers) and the units must be consistent (we use mm). When importing the text file you have to specify the units used on the Import Global Target window (again we use mm). Once the targets have been imported into the new PolyWorks project you set the tracker somewhere in the workspace with a good view of global target nests and measure them. The tracker then automatically aligns to the coordinates of the global targets thereby automatically aligning itself to the LVEA local coordinate system. We did this using a blank project and the results are shown in the 5th attached picture. For the height marks we used the same nominal coordinates from the alignment (2nd picture again). This is why they look so far off at first glance but if you compare the measured coordinates they match really good. For the PSI monuments we used a different toolilng to take those measurements. Instead of the sphere fit rod we used our Hubbs Center Punch Nest (CPN). This nest has a 2"" vertical offset (the center of the SMR sits 2"" above the bottom of the nest) and a built-in center punch for either making punch marks in monuments or accurately setting the nest in an existing punch mark. Because of this we had to remove the z-axis correction for the punch depth we needed for the sphere fit rod as the Hubbs CPN measures to the monument surface not the bottom of the punch. These also look really good with the exception of the measured z-axis coordinate for PSI-2. At this time I don't really have an explanation for this discrepancy. We also used these test coordinates to take some preliminary shots of the 2 accessible -X WHAM1 support tube ends details of that in a future alog (this one is long enough already). While pulling screenshots off of the FARO laptop for this alog I also exported the device position targets from our main working file as these are the global targets we are going to use going forward (FARO_CS_LVEA_Global_Targets_v1.xlsx). Between the main working file and the test file used to generate the global target list for the test in the two immediately preceding paragraphs the only difference is a new device position in the main file position 14 position 14 was necessary in the main working file as the FARO was sitting in the same spot for a week between maintenance windows (March 18 to March 25) and had therefore drifted in that timeframe (the FARO and tripod stand are heavy and slowly sink into the vinyl floor of the LVEA). The fix for this is to do a Move Device action without actually moving the device which accounts for any drift from the previous position. The starting unaligned coordinates of the red nests (which we turn into global targets) are the same the alignment results are the same again the only difference is that new position 14 in the main working file. While removing the BT nests from the target list (since we are not going to use these for placing the FARO) I noticed that the coordinates looked a little different than I remembered. So I threw together a quick and dirty comparison spreadsheet to calculate the differences (Global_Target_Coordinate_Differences.xlsx). The first 4 columns of data are from the main working file the next r columns of data are from the test file and the final 3 columns are the difference (test - main). Sure enough the coordinates from the main file differ from the test file. I set conditional formatting to turn red for any differences outside of +/-0.1 mm. The largest differences are all in z-axis coordinates and the largest of these are all nests placed along the input arm of the IFO (WHAM1/2/3) where are device position uncertainties are the largest. These are small differences the largest being on the order of 0.25 mm spread out over 10s of meters of LVEA space so I don't think this is a big issue but interesting to note nonetheless. And that's it! I'll write another alog detailing the preliminary shots of the WHAM1 -X support tube ends. The FARO is ready to go for the upcoming pre-deinstall shots of the WHAM1 passive stack (currently slated for Monday on the Trello). This finally closes LHO WP 11757 .

The drop was because the OPO PZT ran out of range see t-cursor on attached plot . It's a known issue that the SQZ angle (and alignment) changes with different PZT1 voltage. It seems like that the sqz angle was set for 60-70V and was bad once we relocked at 100V. This would have been improved by taking SQZ_MANAGER to SCAN_SQZANG_FDS so it can find the best sqz angle again. If we were running the SQZ_ANG_ADJUST servo this may have improved itself as you can see the ADF reported SQZ angle change at the time. With the higher (19 vs 11) NLG 83665 the range and 350Hz SQZ (yellow BLRMS) does seem to be improved but the high frequency SQZ did seem to be less stable as we thermalized. ,"{'term': 'H1 SQZ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",83676,camilla.compton@ligo.org

The first plot shows some assumptions that go into making this model we start with an assumption about arm power use the noise budget estimate of non quantum noise at 2kHz (which may be out of date now) and set the readout losses to fit the no squeezing data at 2.1-2.3kHz. Then subtract this quantum noise model without squeezing from the no squeezing data and use that as an estimate of the non-quantum noise which can be added to all of the quantum noise models for different squeezing angles to compare to the measurement. (second plot is a somewhat overwhelming plot of all this added for completeness). I've set the phase noise to 0 based on 83457 . Using the level of sqz and anti-squeeze at 2.1-2.3 kHz we infer that the NLG was 63 and the total efficency was 66.5%. Camilla measured the NLG to be 58 for 120uW circulating power but in 83370 she measured 61-63 for 120uW. The third plot here shows the data that Camilla took with the LO loop unlocked so that the squeezing angle is averaging and rotating freely. Using this and knowledge of the NLG we should be able to infer the total squeezing efficiency as a function of frequency . Doing the subtraction of non quantum noise increases the infered efficiency (compare thick lines to thin) the two different values of NLG suggest rather different efficiencies. There is evidence that the efficiency frequency dependent which could be caused by a number of effects. Below 200 Hz there is some excess noise in the mean sqz trace as you can see here which causes the efficiency infered to be above 1. The next two plots show the model broken into more readable plots with the only thing I've adjusted by hand being the SRC detuning. There is a discrepancy between the model + noise for the anti-squeezing and anti-squeezing +/-10 degrees traces without the filter cavity which seems like it could be some excess noise that is similar for the different traces. This is similar to the discrepancy seen in the last plot in 82097 but it is larger in this higher NLG dataset. ,"{'term': 'H1 SQZ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",83666,sheila.dwyer@ligo.org

As there is coupling from DARM to DHARD and then DHARD back to DARM this changes the DARM OLG and thus the sensing function. I tried to check on whether the sensing function was affected by DHARD currently by looking at the coherence between low frequency PCAL lines below 20 Hz in DARM. The only one we still use is 17.1Hz there where others used to monitor the low frequency sensing function and the SRC detuning but these are no longer in use. The other calibration lines still in use below 20Hz are injections on the ETMX suspension. Francisco looked at this in 2024 in alog # 80267 for different offset values of the AS A WFS cwhich are used as a sensor in DHARD. For a setting of 0 which matches the current setting of this offset the coherence (bottom graph) between DARM and DHARD looks like it is bellow 1 at 17.1 Hz the SRCL1_OFFSET at the time was -290 counts. I compared short spectra of DARM with coherences from CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ to ASC-DHARD_P_SM_DQ and ASC-DHARD_Y_SM_DQ. See this image . For the detunings used the 17.1Hz line only seems to show up strongly in the -90 count offset see image of the darm spectra in the top left graph DARM coherence with DHARD_P in the middle row left graph DARM coherence with DHARD_Y in the bottom left graph and the DHARD_P spectra in the top right graph. From the spectra it looks like the 17.1 Hz line is almost buried in the noise for most of the detunings. Since all these measurements only used ~ 3 mins of data I decided to compare the hour long period from this entry where Camilla had the SRCL1 offset at -290 counts to a period after commissioning was over when it was back at the nominal of -191 counts. See this image where I have also added a graph of DHARD_Y spectrum in the middle right of the image. Purple is the -290 count SRCL offset and Yellow is the -191 count offset. The coupling of the PCAL line to DHARD P and Y does not really change between the two different detunings but since there is some coupling to DHARD we might want to revisit the AS A WFS offset. Also the coherence from DARM to DHARD_Y (bottom left graph in my first image below) for the same SRCL1 OFFSET (-290 counts see this image) as Francisco's measurement was 0.6 compared to the 0.1 coherence he found so that might be a reason to keep looking at this issue. Finally I include an ndscope of the optical spring frequency (f_S) and the coupled cavity pole frequency (f_C) changing with the detuning. NB: For future me that optical spring frequency channel defaults to zero when the calculated value is very small I think.

Did a blowdown after it hit slightly positive then closed the all-metal valve between HAM1/HAM2 that's the vent port. The adjacent volumes didn't have any noticably pressure change so it looks like the seals held fine. We also did a burp test on the HAM1/HAM2 annulus saw nothing and vented HAM1/HAM2 annulus. It looks like there are no noticable inner door seal leaks on HAM1's or HAM2's doors. Work is complete and other may now be within 6 ft of HAM1. Showed Joe H the state of the valves for future purgeing of the chamber in the case we are not around. The KF-40 across from the pressure relief valve on the KF-40 cross has no o-ring and just the cap sitting there with a clamp. Butterfly valve is barely cracked open.

Issac Jorge TJ Huyen] Today we started preping the HAM1 HEPI for the upcomming passive stack/ISI work. We managed to lock the HEPI within +/- 1000 counts from floating state see figure 1. Then we proceeded to disconnected the HEPI actuator leaving them minimum 5mm gap see figure 2. We also centered the actuators within their housing (using ~2.5mm shims) so that we don't have to worry about it when reconnecting them see figure 3. As a check after locking HEPI we did install dial-indicators at the first corner (on HEPI beam) as test of how much disconnecting actuator moves HEPI if any and it did not move more than 2thou (0.05mm) in horizontal direction and close to none in the vertical direction (see figure4). The corresponding IPS signals for the rest of the corners during this test were also not changing. This said that the HEPI was locked tightly before we decided to move on to the other corners. At last using FARO we checked the positions of the ends of support tubes (vs. references taken before these works) and the support tubes were somewhat at the same positions within 0.25mm in Y and 0.1mm in X and Z see figure 56). ,"{'term': 'L1 SEI', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",75935,huyen.pham@ligo.org

Several issues were found: Due to a BOM error resistors R15 and R21 were stuffed with 3kΩ thick film resistors instead of metal film. Plot 1 shows the output referred noise measure at test point TP1. The blue curve was measured with a grounded input whereas the red curve was measured with a 9V battery at the input. The later clearly shows the flicker noise of a carbon film resistor at roughly 600nV/√ f. The power supply input of the whitening board eomploys 10µH series inductors. Together with the bypass capacitors this forms a resonant circuit near 10kHz which shows up as a noise peak in the plots. Plot 2 shows the output noise with no whitening engaged for the original board (blue curve) the board with fixed 3kΩ resistors (green) and with the power supply indcutors shorted out (red). The gain stages will generate excess noise when over driven. The whitening board employs 4 switchable gain stages with 24 12 6 and 3dB of gain respectively. With 9V input both the 24 and 12dB stage are over driven with their ouput voltage limited by the power supply rails. This will in turn lead to a large differential input voltage at the inputs of the OpAmp which then triggers the protection diodes. The current is limited by the 300Ω resistors (R11) in series with the + input. Even so it is safe to operate like this it can generate execss noise as seen in Plot 3 . The blue curve shows the output noise with the input grounded whereas the red curve uses a 9V battery at the input. The green curve shows the noise of the SR785 and the battery alone. Plot 4 shows the 9V input noise using the optional whitening stages. A whitening stage consist of a 1Hz zero and a 10Hz pole. Plot 5 shows the same plot but with the 300Ω resistors removed the 3kΩ resistors replaced with metal films and the inductors at the power supply shorted out. Plot 6 is an overlay of Plots 4 and 5.

The loops on RM2 excited the suspension until it was causing overflows. This continued all night. It seems strange that the loops that were damping well two days ago are now not damping ( ndscope1 ). I noticed that turning off only the L damping solved the issue of the MASTER_OUTs slowly increasing. Doing some tests (starting in SAFE and then going to DAMPED) it looks like damping is fine for the first few minutes after which it very quickly starts exciting instead of damping ( ndscope2 ndscope3 ) and the voltmons start going crazy. I did this test a few times with the same result every time. Doing the same test but immediately switching L damping off as soon as it turns on we stay just damping P and Y and have no issues with oscillations or saturations ( ndscope4 ). I am not sure if this means that the issue is specifically with the Length damping? I am putting RM2 in SAFE for now and I'm going to try the same tests on RM1 and PM1 to see if the same issue exists there.

50532,H1 ISC - Modeling REFL path from Beam Profile Measurements,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84410,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 15 May 2025 15:22:28 -0700",[Sheila Elenna] Alog 84230 contains an extensive report of the beam profile measurements in HAM1 along the REFL path. Keita did a fit of the measurements along the WFS sled to determine that the gouy phase separation of the REFL WFS is good. I have now taken all the data starting just before RM1 through the WFS sled measurements and run a fit. Looking back at T1300960 which does a similar fit model from the measurements in the REFL path there is some confusion about what the input q to HAM1 is and this resulted in some doubt about the radius of curvature of both RM1 and M5 whose design specs are 1.7 m. That code uses RoCs that are 1.75 m for each mirror which Sheila and I think is a bit far out of the range of the specification (see E1100056 ). There is a total of 8 measurements four taken around the WFS sled and four taken around the RM1-RM2-M5 area (a ninth measurement of the beam size at the LSC REFL diodes is not included). I added these measurements to the model as well as RM1 RM2 M5 L101 and L102. I ran a fit based on these components and the beam profile measurements. The beam path results are shown in this first plot where RM1 and M5 RoC are set to 1.7 m (as in spec). The astigmatism shows waists upstream of RM1 are separated by over 1 m. I color coded traces for horizontal and vertical and o's and x's mark the measurement locations that were fit. However I didn't include any angle of incidence in this calculation which would probably adjust this result slightly (it appears the AOIs are probably 10 degrees or less). For completeness I also included the results if we assume the RM1 and M5 RoC are 1.75 m in this plot . In this result the upstream waists are 2 m apart. For both fits I used the qs that Paul and Lisa calculated as the seed qs in T1300960. Sheila and I are in the process of confirming these qs by doing the beam propagation of the IMC waist to the HAM1 table. To clarify a la mode forces you to supply some input seed beam for propagation and fitting so I supplied this seed since you want to use something you think is pretty close to the true value. However it only uses that seed as a starting point and then fits the data points supplied. The resulting incoming beam to RM1 is fit as: horizontal = waist 1.60 mm 6.4 m upstream of RM1 (RM1 RoC 1.7 m) vertical = waist 1.52 mm 7.5 m upstream of RM1 (RM1 RoC 1.7 m) or horizontal = waist 1.99 mm 2.07 m upstream of RM1 (RM1 RoC 1.75 m) vertical = waist 2.06 mm 4.2 m upstream of RM1 (RM1 RoC 1.75 m) The code I wrote is attached to this alog.

50545,H1 ISC - ALS Beckhoff vs Guardian locking error codes and expanded thresholds,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84387,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Wed, 14 May 2025 16:45:38 -0700","Sheila D TJ S. Summary : the ALS arm guardians will now log the Beckhoff fiber locking error messages (untested though testing later) and I've relaxed some of the thresholds set in Beckhoff. This is all nice but I don't anticipate major gains from this. Why: Our ALS locking has not been as reliable as it once was and has been one of the primary reasons for our locking not being fully autonomous. We have been discussing ways to help our ALS locking without large scale ALS table mode matching efforts that would be very time and resource heavy and has the chance to impact the ALS system negatively while we are still in a run. One issue that Sheila pointed out was that there were some times before this recent break that the Beckhoff automation code would flag some type of error and then stop the locking automation the guardian node would see this and drop to the unlocked state and then start over. Sheila thinks that the Beckhoff errors are often based on far too strict of thresholds and we should rely more on the guardian node for the error checking. Guardian Changes: While the Beckhoff error codes for fiber locking are in the DAQ (H1:ALS-X_FIBR_LOCK_ERROR_CODE) this binary value needs a map to convert it back to something human readable. The guardian node doesn't look at these directly either so we don't currently have an easy way to see what the Beckhoff automation is failing on...until now! The binary first has to be converted to hex then the hex values and their associated error codes were found in a table from E1300482 . I wrote a quick dictionary with a string message for the different binary values that are in epics. I've added this into the ALS nodes as a decorator to many different locking states. It will frequently check if there are any errors and log them so we can track what is happening a bit better. It won't be perfect though since it's just a decorator and it's possible that we will miss some of these error messages. What codes have we been seeing? So in terms of error codes what has been happening? In 2025 there was a trend in the X arm error codes that was seen during some times where ALS was fussy. Attachment 1 is an example where there is a ""beat note out of range of frequency comparator"" followed by a ""laser error"" code. This generally only lasts a few minutes though and it looks like there were issues before these codes popped up. For the Y arm the error codes are up for <1second and will often happen a minute or more after the arm loses lock so I don't think this is too useful. The most common error codes that pop up are: Reference cavity transmission PD error Reference cavity transmission below the limit Beat note power too low. Threshold Changes: One thing that has already been done was lower the PLL reference cavity transmission low limit (ref cav trans low limit) - alog83547 . Today I changed the PLL beat note frequency range from 3MHz-150Mhz to 2MHz-350MHz. The max frequency I saw was near 300MHz so 350 seemed like enough to get it out of the way. Beat note minimum was already at -40dB well out of the way already (see attachment 2 for examples). There might be some more places to relax the Beckhoff thresholds but these related to the most common errors that we saw. Except for the very vague ""Laser error"" code. This will need more time to look into. OpsInfo ","{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",84387,thomas.shaffer@ligo.org

With a couple of issues that continued from last week and were addressed: Soft Sand-- This has been an issue because it is fairly easy to get aerial lift wheels stuck in the sand. Because of this and since the big rental aerial lift was in position near the 1st panel (or ""southernmost panel"") it was decided to do this panel's rework in one shot (vs the usual procedure of doing a step for all panel positions and then moving to next steps for all positions and so on) Bee Hive--Last Thursday a beehive swarmed the wooden spool for the large wire.

This work shows a more signifcant impact of the spherical aberrations and HOM thermal distortions on the SRCL detuning than the mode mismatch or misalignment. Building on the previous study of how mode mismatch affects SRCL detuning I now turn to exploring the thermal effects on SRCL detuning. When laser light passes through optics a small portion of it is absorbed leading to some heating. This thermal absorption causes the optic to either physically deform or develop a refractive index gradient both of which can distort the wavefront. More background on this process is available. A thermally distorted thin lens can be thought of as a combination of a quadratic lens term and a residual distortion that includes spherical aberrations and other higher-order modes. In FINESSE we simulate this by generating an optical path difference (OPD) map based on the absorbed power. We then fit and subtract the quadratic component which corresponds to the ideal thin lens (the effect explored in the earlier study). The remaining residuals represent the non-quadratic distortions we’re now interested in analyzing for their impact on SRCL detuning. It’s important to note that in this model the cavity geometry like the radius of curvature remains unchanged. As a result mode mismatch is not a factor in this part of the analysis. These residual distortions have a stronger effect on detuning than the lensing term alone as shown in the plots below. This model assumes 0.13 ppm absorption in the ITM coatings. The model fails to lock with higher absorption values. No thermal effects are applied to the ETMs in this analysis. The first plot shows how SRCL detuning changes as the input power—and thus the circulating power—increases from 10 W to 60 W. The right-hand y-axis shows the percentage change for reference. The second plot illustrates how the sensing functions shift with increasing power. These are normalized to their value at 100 Hz for easier comparison. When compared with earlier results the impact of thermal distortion on the sensing function becomes clearly visible at low frequencies.

We had to add an inch of shims beneath to motor mount in order to get it to fit/align properly but otherwise there were only minor complications during installation. We've tested the pico-motor and the mass adjuster using the pico-motor driver that we brought from UW and both seem to work fine. For in air balancing we left the new mass adjuster centered to increase range for future adjustments for when the BRS is pumped down and running and tried to just stick to moving masses that are inaccessible when the BRS chamber is pumped down. We unfortunately reached the maximum range with the internal masses and had to slightly move the manual mass adjustment system (what is currently used to adjust the center of mass) from center but that might be returned to center after we re-balance it when it's pumped down. Right now the resonance frequency looks to be around ~7mHz (around 130 second period) which is about the same as it was before Mass Adjuster installation but we'll check again after the chamber has been pumped down.Tomorrow we'll finish all of the wiring and electronics to hook up the pico-motor to the LIGO system. The plan is to pump down the BRS chamber tomorrow and re-balance and test the pico-motor some more.The reference pattern has a higher intensity than expected and we aren't sure why.

POP LSC Pico: This pico was too close ot the edge of its range so I turned the mirror mount so there was range and realigned onto the center of the POP LSC diode. Beamdumps: Photos of all beamdumps will be placed in 84321 will also make an updated map to show where the new beamdumps are located. With both ITMs and PRM aligned the POP flashes were brighter (thanks Elenna) and we were able to check the beam was aligned onto BD1 and BD2. We placed BD6a and BD6bwith BD6a between M14 and HW1 which is further upstream that Keita placed it last time 63595 . We actually had this dump catching to ghost beams coming off HW1 (one round and the other a more unusual clipped shape) there was no clipping of HW1. We found the ghost beams that BD7 and BD9 were catching one was already caught by BD8 and we placed BD7 on the -Y side of the SLED to catch the other. We found a lot of ghost beams mainly from Betsy using a combination of IR viewer on the card and curtains. Extra beams found: Two secondary off the REFL BDV1 that are ghost beams from the intal M7/M1/M17 optics transmitted through M1 but too close to block well before the beam divertor. As our low noise state is with this BDV1 closed we changed the size of the places in BD5 to catch all three beams (main + 2 ghost). Note that these beams when reflected off M1 are blocked by BD7 and BD8. There as also a beam being defected very low from ASC REFL B and bouncing off the ISI table Betsy added a beamdump without post to catch this on the -Y side of the SLED. NO beam like this off the other ASC diodes. Betsy and Jenne could a faint beam and disc on the +Y septum door but we couldn't understand where these were coming from. Final Checks: We checked ndscope for all LSC and ASC diodes while blocking and unblocking the beam to check there was signal on all. Yesterday Elenna and I removed all of the temporary metal name tags and this morning I checked that there were no thumb knobs left on any optics. As it doesn't make sense for PM1 to be misaligned we suggest having misaligned offsets of (00) for this although if we really wanted a setting of (15001500) would ge the beam off the diodes.

The fit range is from 5 to 15 Hz. The attached plots show the before and after of the process. A few observations: 1) As we had seen before the Left and Right (LF and RT) OSEMs are pretty well matched to one another which bodes well for our PR3 Yaw OSEM estimator plans. 2) The T1|T2|T3 OSEMs that measure the vertical direction have their orientation flipped respect to the model. I don't think there's a problem but it is worth pointing out. 3) The T1 OSEM which is used to distinguish roll is 70% off from T1 and T2. The large factor feels concerning but it is consistent with other measurements of SR3. See for example 83963 where in the attached .pdf the Vertical to roll coupling is very clean (page 12). And the difference of T1 T2 and T3 can be seen very directly in page 24. - I think it might be worth revisiting some of these transfer functions after recalibrating just to confirm that we're getting the numbers right.

We drove the container over the overpass drove the truck faster (upto 50mph vs. 30mph last time) a little abruptedly along the arms drove forklift over some bumpy ground. This time to compare the motion of new QUAD lift and the Genie lift we used the Genie lift to transport the lower QUAD from container to the new QUAD lift see figure 1 & 2 . Overall the truck is still noisiest motion. The forklift is the 2nd to loudest noise. We hit the saturations few times (~50m/s2) on the accelerometers during these truck and forklift drive. The new QUAD lift is really quiet and smooth compared to other transporting methods . The results are in the 3 pdfs attached: The 1st pdf is the all data with time series for each test and the last few pages are comparison of data when plotting together. The ASD comparison is a bit messy to look at. The 2nd pdf is the data comparison of moving motion using different transporting devices.

At ASC REFL B WFS the issue was traced to the D2500010 SN S1301474 cable not making full contact at the Q1/Q4 connector. Reseating the cable restored nominal transfer functions. Additionally during in-air handling at the flange several pins on the coax-to-SMA adapter were found to be pushed back. These were replaced to ensure proper connectivity. For PM1 continuity tests ruled out electrical faults and functional testing using the old ZM2 Tip-Tilt confirmed the electronics were not the source of the issue. The problem was that the Eddy Current Dampers behind the optic were restricting the motion. It was a little inconspicuous but these were mounted on set screws that could be accessed from the back. After backing these off the suspension behaved as expected. OSEMs were re-centered transfer functions were nominal and POP beam path alignment was verified. Joe B Josh C Stuart A Bob C Matt H Adam M Karla R All particle counts are reported in counts per cubic foot for 0.3 μm / 0.5 μm / 1.0 μm particle sizes. All times are CDT. Morning Log 09:40 – Entry cleanroom particle counts: 0 / 0 / 0 09:45 – Joe B. and Josh C. are troubleshooting the drive issue on PM1. 09:55 – Bob is removing the feedthrough from the 5-way cross for D1-1D7 and D1-1D8 related to the ASC REFL B WFS. 10:03 – Entry in-chamber particle counts: 80 / 20 / 10 10:12 – Adam and Bob report that the feedthrough appears to be in good condition with no visible issues or dislodged connections. 10:17 – Replaced the SMA cable adaptor connected to RF_25 at D1-1D8. However TF readings for Q1 and Q4 remain problematic. 10:27 – Adam suggested an additional diagnostic test before proceeding with the full 5-way coax cable replacement. During this test we found that the cable connected to the top of ASC REFL B for Q1/Q4 was not fully seated. After properly reseating the cable the TFs briefly appeared nominal confirming that a poor connection was contributing to the issue. 10:30 – Bob is reinstalling the previously removed feedthrough on the 5-way cross. We'll rerun TFs to confirm functionality before closing out the issue. 10:56 – The issue persists on Channel 1 when tightening the cable screws indicating a possible pin misalignment or incomplete contact during reconnection. 10:58 – PM1 Update: A continuity test will be performed for each pin from the SatAmp cable to the D1000225 cable connected to PM1. 11:05 – Beginning continuity test for PM1 referencing schematic D080276. 11:15 PM1: Continuity test passed—no shorts or open pins detected. Stuart will now inspect the PM1 suspension and verify OSEM centering. 11:25 – Adam and Stuart report that the back view of the PM1 suspension suggests either an OSEM or the optic itself may be slightly rotated. 11:25 – Bob reconnected the cable to the feedthrough and carefully assembled the backshell ensuring a secure connection. TF checks now show expected performance. 11:50 – Replaced the 5-way coax to SMA adapter for RF_25 at D1-1D8. Transfer functions now look good. The issue with ASC REFL B WFS has been resolved. 11:54 – Stuart is running a quick TF test on PM1. TFs still appear off-nominal. 12:00 – Running TFs on ASC REFL B WFS for final confirmation. 12:08 – Exit in-chamber particle counts: 60 / 40 / 30 12:10 – Exit cleanroom particle counts: 20 / 0 / 0 William P (contamination control) Bob C Michael L Josh C Joe B Stuart A Matt H Adam M Karla R.

Afternoon Log 13:46 – Entry cleanroom particle counts: 0 / 0 / 0 13:52 – Entry in-chamber particle counts: 50 / 30 / 10 13:56 – Matt and Adam are preparing the old ZM2 for testing using the electronics chain currently connected to PM1. The goal is to determine whether the issue originates from the electronics or the mechanical aspects of the PM1 suspension. 14:03 – The old ZM2 Tip-Tilt suspension has been placed on the HAM1 table. We are installing Quadrupus cable D1000228-v3 SN S1105226 for testing on old ZM2 14:08 – Unlocking the top blades and backing off the front EQ stops on the old ZM2. 14:10 – Old ZM2 is now free. 14:15 – Adam is centering the OSEMs on the old ZM2. 14:22 – Driving the old ZM2. It continues to exhibit the same behavior as PM1 and the transfer functions remain unchanged. 14:31 – Testing old ZM2 using RM2 electronics. 14:40 – Swapped the D1000225 cable connecting PM1 to the feedthrough with a spare and connected it to a spare DB25 feedthrough to test whether the issue was related to the currently installed feedthrough at D6-2C. No improvement was observed. 14:50 – Adam discovered a set screw behind the Eddy Current damper positioned very close to the optic. After backing off the set screw the PM1 suspension began to swing indicating the suspension had not been completely free. 14:53 – PM1 electronics reconnected to PM1 suspension. 14:58 – Re-centering PM1 OSEMs. 15:05 – PM1 transfer functions appear to be good. 15:25 – Matt is transitioning LVEA to Laser Hazard. 15:42 – In-chamber particle counts: 80 / 40 / 30 15:45 – Bob is working on the D1 flange. 16:00 – Old ZM2 has been placed back inside its can and returned to the HAM3 cleanroom. 16:20 – Will P is installing a vertical wafer positioning it closer to the center of the table and RM1. 16:35 – Setting excitation on PRM. 16:36 – Removing the septum viewport covers on the HAM2 side. 16:39 – LVEA is now in LASER HAZARD state. 16:45 – HAM2 ISI is tripping preventing us from locking the IMC.

In the morning we re-tested the ASC POP X WFS DC chain for continuity and confirmed the finding from the other day that pin 12 (outside) to pin 22 (inside) was open. We had tested the outside cable the other day so I swapped out the inside D1000225 cable after first testing the new cable. With Begum's help we re-checked the whole chain (it was all good). We also connected the beam-diverters and made sure they opened and closed on command. In the afternoon we carried out transfer function measurements (test input to RF outputs) on all of the RFPD channels (LSC and ASC). Every channel looked good except the 9 and 45 MHz channel 1 (quadrant 1) responses on ASC REFL B which was just noise. These channels correspond to the 1st and 2nd channel of the ISC_RF25 (in-air) -> D2500010-S1301474 (in-vac) or q1/q4 cable chain. We debugged by swapping the in-air cable at the flange with the q2/q4 chain's. The bad response stayed with the in-vac cable so we know that the problem is in-vacuum. Matt disconnected inspected and re-connected the cable at the WFS this didn't resolve the issue. So likely the problem is at the flange connector of the in-vac cable. Unfortunately this is inside the 5-way cross so we'll need to pull back the feed-through to diagnose. We plan to do this first thing tomorrow. I've attached the measurements of the good RFPD responses.

We did have a cable failure at 8:15 AM for the D3 CPS Triax G3-1G1 port. When I brushed up against the cables while walking my glove around the flange and the cable ejected itself from the barrel assembly and went between HAM1/HAM2 in the very middle. See attached photo. The cable center pin assembly hex nut on the back with the blue epoxy(?) wasn't fully torqued. It had less than a fraction of a turn holding it in. After fishing out from under the center screwing it on it did the same thing. The 10mm hex on the cable needed to be held while the barrel was tightened on via wrench flats with a very thin 10mm wrench. Set torque to a few inch-lbs. When hand-tight the barrel would unscrew itself from the cable once you tried tightening on the feedthrough. I realized later that the inner barrel on the Triax is missing likely came off when it smacked the pier or concrete underneight HAM1/HAM2. So the whole cable might need to be replaced. Bummer but better it fail now than ejecting itself during obersvation. Torquing of the Seismic feedthroughs all went well from a vacuum perspective. Work is finished flanges were fully compressed by lunch. Waiting on the 5-way crosses so we can finish up the ISC feedthroughs. Nothing got removed except the D3 flange top Triax D3-1G1 & D3-1G2 air cables. After the top port fell between the HAM1/HAM2 HEPI piers took the bottom Triax port off to give me better access to bolts facing the pier. NOTE: top feedthrough port needs to be inspected to make sure nothing was left behind when the cable ejected from the barrel. I couldn't see what I was looking at did not have an inspection mirror or a good enough camera on me. It is possible the inner barrel outer triax shell or a piece got left inside the feedthrough when the cable ejected itself from the barrel this morning at 8:15 AM instead of falling below HAM1/HAM2. I was just thinking about it writing the a-log this needs to be investigated when a replacement cable gets put in. ,"{'term': 'LLO VE', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",76684,robert.cottingham@ligo.org

Josh and Garret inspected and measured the cable and found an intermittant connection on Pin 1 of the DB9 at the SatAmp end. The cable was cut back and reterminated. There was a change in response for CH1 of the TF but not enough to call it fixed. It was also noted by Anamaria that the OSEM spectra for PM1 was suspect.

The difference in weight (lower QUAD vs. lower QUAD + cage) and lifting position (higher vs. lower than COM) may contribute to why the genie lift motion is the most quiet of them all.

Here I post some data for the energy we see on lock losses. The attached histogram splits the data into two distinct time periods: Before and after the HAM6 incursion for fix the fast shutter [ 73706 ]. The power seen on the lock loss appears considerably lower after the AS Camera box rework so it appears the BS at its' present angle is rejecting certain polarisations of the lock loss pulse differently to before. For reasons not entirely well communicated to me the entire layout of the AS Camera box was ripped out and re-done. It would appear that the power that reaches the PD is highly sensitive to the angle of the two 90:10 beam splitters (BS) that can be found inside. When the box was rebuilt I made an effort to restore the power on the PD to the same as the power seen before the work (during lock) with a small update to the calibration of that PD. Notably the angle of the last BS proved particularly sensitive to the power seen in transmission. I estimate the peak power of about 100mW before the last BS on what I estimate is a beam radius ~1mm lasting about 1 second. Before implementing this we were concerned we would just be damaging ND filters if we used them and opted for the second beam splitter and this sort of power is comparable Throlabs ND filter damage thresholds of about 10 W/cm^2 though the beam might be a bit bigger. The PD has been offline since January still waiting on a new power source solution. TLDR: We see as much as 15 J of power on lock losses but the figure is very much a ball park figure due to sensitivity to internal alignment of optics in AS Camera box.

In the morning we realigned the REFL-to-air beam using the viewport reference and the wall reference. Because we only had one mirror available we could only perfectly align to one of these references that reference being the wall reference. The beam was aligned well with both references in yaw but when centered on the wall reference it was a little low on the viewport but this offset wasn’t significant enough to worry about. We then focused on the POP alignment. First we locked PRX after re-phasing the REFL LSC 9MHz signal but this power was still too small to see so we set the IFO alignment configuration to PRMI and drove PRM to get a flashing POP beam. We aligned this to the viewport and wall references. This took a while as we had difficulties tracking the faint flashing beam to the wall. Later after re-centering the M16 mirror about the beam we realized we must have been clipping slightly on M16 and losing a significant amount of power. We then roughly aligned the in-vac path adjusting PM1 to center on the WFS and then centering the lens L2 and the 50/50 beam-splitter M15 on the beam. We aligned M15 to center the beam on the LSC PD. There were still issues with the PM1 tip-tilt (transfer functions weren’t clean) so we didn’t want to finalize the POP VAC alignment just yet. Anamaria spent some time re-centering the PM1 BOSEMs. At the same time I connected the remaining RF coax cables except for POP LSC as we couldn’t find the right allen key to fasten the connector to the PD. Later in the afternoon after taking the back-shell off we learnt that the hole to access the screw was smaller than the required allen key for this we’ll try to replace the cable. In the afternoon we split into two teams. Louis and Begum had found from previous day’s measurements that the beam size on REFL WFS A was <250um much smaller than we were willing to live with so the decision was made to reduce the distance between the L101 and L102 lens by 5mm and then quickly remeasure these beam sizes and possibly a few more if time permitted. They will share their results soon. Once they had made these changes and retaken their beam profile measurements they centered the beam on the REFL WFS as well as they could (the REFL WFS beam was moving a bit too much to center perfectly). On the side Anamaria and I quickly aligned the ALS/PSL beam to the viewport and wall references and then we rolled the ISCT1 table into the clean-room to it’s nominal location and checked the alignment on the periscope mirrors. We decided to lower the POP beam on the top mirror a little. After ISCT1 was rolled back out. A combination of both teams carried out a REFL power budget number’s can be found in the first afternoon activity log. Note that the 50/50 beam-splitter in front of LSC REFL PD was rotated to give a more optimal 45 degree AOI which did have a significant effect on the transmission of this mirror so that initial measurement is wrong. This was re-measured after and the numbers for that are in the 2nd activity log. RM2 had significant offsets (⅓ of the range mostly yaw) and so these were offloaded mechanically by rotating the tip-tilt and adjusting the pitch-adjuster screw on the front. We also began aligning the beam dumps to catch ghost beams but ran out of time. We’ve almost finished with the laser/alignment work we still need to measure the beam height above the table (a request from Masayuki for JAC design) finalize the POP VAC alignment and finish placing the beam dumps. A few electrical issues have popped up (PM1 might be a cable issue) so we may want to wrap up alignment first thing tomorrow morning so we can focus on resolving these.,"{'term': 'L1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",76645,adam.mullavey@ligo.org

We had previously done this process for a slightly earlier calibration measurement with guidance from Joe. Upon inspection of the report Joe recommended that we change the parameter is_pro_spring from False to True which significantly improved the fit of the calibration. The report that Tony uploaded in his alog includes that fit change. Since we were happy with this fit Francisco reran the pydarm report this time requesting the generation of the GDS filters. After this completed we inspected the comparison of the FIR filters with the DARM model and saw very good agreement between 10 and 1000 Hz. Two things we want to point out are that the nonsens filter fits included a lot of ripple a low frequency but it still looks small enough that we think it is ""ok"". We also saw some large line features at high frequency in the TST filters which Joe had previously assured us was ok. While online with Joe we had also confirmed that the DARM actuation parameters such as gains and filters matched in three locations: in the suspension model itself in the CAL CS model and in the pydarm ini file. Since we confirmed this was all looking good Francisco and I proceeded with the next steps which we followed from Jeff's alog here 83088 . We ran these commands in this order: pydarm commit 20250610T224009Z --valid pydarm export --push 20250610T224009Z pydarm upload 20250610T224009Z pydarm gds restart At this point Jeff notes that he had to wait 12 minutes running "" pydarm gds status "" and running the broadband measurement to confirm the calibration is good. Francisco and I also knew we needed to check the status of the calibration lines on grafana. However a few minutes after we started the clock on this wait time the IFO lost lock. We think the calibration is good but we have not actually been able to confirm this which means we cannot go into observing tomorrow (Wednesday) before making this confirmation. Doing so requires some locked time with calibration lines on and a broadband injection for a final verification of this new calibration. The hope is that we can achieve this tonight but if not we must do so tomorrow before going into observing. (Note: because of the different rules of ""engineering"" data versus ""observing"" data we could go into observing mode tonight without this confirmation).","{'term': 'H1 CAL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",84953,elenna.capote@ligo.org

The next lock we went through this state step by step and step of reducing the SRCL1 gain from -18 to -7.5 is what started the issue. Setting this back to -18 seemed to get rid of the 1Hz signal in SRCL but the oscillation continued to grow in PRG and other channels. Then Elenna set CHARD P back to the high bandwith configuration by undo-ing line 4569 in ISC_LOCK by doing: ezca.switch('ASC-CHARD_P' 'FM9' 'ON') ezca.switch('ASC-CHARD_P' 'FM3' 'FM8' 'OFF') ezca['ASC-CHARD_P_GAIN'] = 80 This stopped the oscillation then we were able to set the SRCL gain back down to -7.5 without issue then undo the CAHRD P changes again wihtout issue. We don't understand this but we have again moved the location of LOWNOISE_ASC in the guardian so that the CHARD changes will happen before the SRCL gain reduction next time we relock. Note to operators: If you see this 1 Hz bussing in the PRG put CHARD into it's high gain state by pasting the above lines into a guardian shell all at once.

This boost was designed by Gabriele to reduce the DHARD P RMS which was beneficial to reducing the DARM RMS This may overall impact the DARM RMS MICH P and Y have been reverted to an older loop design during locking some 0.5 Hz ring ups in the MICH ASC impacted locking even causing a lockloss I changed the loop design back to a design that was in place pre-O4 which uses FM7 instead of FM10 in MICH and FM5 instead of FM10 for MICH Y This may result in more MICH ASC noise coupling to DARM Changing back to this old design has reduced the RMS in MICH P and Y Disengaged BR filter in MICH P and Y I disengaged a bounce/roll filter in the MICH ASC that had been added during O4. We disengaged this same filter in the MICH LSC We may see the beamsplitter B/R modes in DARM but unlikely because we have dampers on the BS for this A new DC centering loop DC6 centers the beam on POPX using PM1 likely very low coupling to DARM PRC2 ASC is now on POPX this would change the noise in the loop however PRC2 has very low coupling to DARM unlikely to impact noise I ran a coherence in NLN with all the arm loops MICH and PRC2 ASC. There is some coherence with CHARD P and with MICH P and Y that would be worth investigating with a noise budget injection. ,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",84939,elenna.capote@ligo.org

In the attached screenshot (not super readable since I had to run to a meeting sorry!) the Y-cursors are set to the values of the various signals just after I reset the green refs yesterday. Then the data traces that are visible in the plots are from the most recent reference setting before that before we reseated the HAM1 door. The TMS pitch and yaw values are all about 1 urad different between the two times (I seem to have zoomed too much on the TMSY Y plot though). The green QPDs particularly the Xarm pit A and then both the Xarm yaws changed. The camera offsets didn't chage much although they did change a bit.

Obviously we'd prefer to mitigate this in hardware but it still seems useful to check up on. There are still several vacuum pumps running near HAM1 so hopefully these jitter peaks won't be as prevalent once they get turned off in a few days. However until then it looks like the cleaning coefficients from before the vent are still good. This makes some sense in that we didn't do a lot that would change our coupling of the jitter noise into the interferometer dramatically.

The IMC ASC PZT has been changed so accepting that. A lockin oscillator in the LSC model had a ramp time change - I've reverted it.

I'm accepting that the input is off in addition to the output being off. This matches the safe.snap. This switch probably got left on when we last did some hardware injections - but it doesn't matter since the output is always correctly off. The ITMY reaction chain alignment offsets are now zero in the safe.snap file since we aligned it in vacuum. I've accepted those values in the observe.snap file.

Because Eric was troubleshooting a heater coil in this particular zone (per WP 12589) this morning this was not terribly surprising but I decided to investigate anyway. According to FMCS heating stage 1 was manually forced on. It appeared to hold at least 40% heating command in this condition. I don't recall a reason for this being manually enabled nor did Eric. Since disabling it heating command dropped from 40% to 0 and supply temperatures have fallen from 73F to 58.

This measurement was mainly done as a test to confirm simulines wasn't breaking the lock so we were not well thermalized. We can first report that simulines did not break the lock so the previous lockloss that occurred during the simulines measurement was likely unrelated to simulines itself. GPS start of measurement: 1433563079 I did a time machine on the calibration monitor screen for the GPS start of the measurement. I was able to generate a report by running pydarm report --skip-gds I have attached the generated PDF from this report and I took a screenshot of the first page since there is an interesting result. The sensing function shows a large spring which is probably due to the fact that we are operating with a significant SRCL offset which is designed to compensate for 1.4 degrees of SRCL detuning 84794 .

We have not yet been able to calibrate because of a very fast lockloss of unknown source. The alog was down for most of the afternoon and evening so I will do my best here to copy mesages from the mattermost chat which served as the temporary alog. Minor struggles in returning to full lock: The first lock we did have to by-hand reduce the CARM offset to go to CARM_TO_REFL successfully. We reset the green references after ASC converged. The next lock (after setting green references and doing an initial alignment) this worked automatically so no changes were made to guardian. MICH P rang up one lockloss so I reverted the MICH ASC control to an older high bandwidth design. We will need to check the impact on the noise later Once we achieved full power we proceeded to try to solve some of the final instabilities leftover from last week. Changes made to avoid locking stability problems: New order of states. We now run: Max Power > Low Noise Coil Drivers > Transition from ETMX > Low noise ESD ETMX > Low Noise ASC > Low noise Length Control we got a lot of saturation warnings because of the amplitude of the ADS lines in coil drivers so the guardian now turns OFF the lines completely and then turns them back on in lownoise ESD I didn't change state numbers but I changed the order and some of the weights to ensure this is the path taken this was tested successfully We no longer engage the DHARD P boost in FM8. This may have some effect on the noise which must be checked later We tested laser noise suppression there are no problems While in OMC whitening I ran a quick DARM OLG with Fransisco. There is slightly less phase but overall it looks fine at least compared to the reference. However we don't have a lot of phase margin in general should we fix that? The plan was to try testing simulines again however! We have had multiple very fast locklosses with no known origin. Two have happened shortly after arriving at OMC whitening. These are not coming from ASC and I don't see any ringup in DARM or LSC loops. ,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",84911,elenna.capote@ligo.org

Mostly done apart form touching up POPAIR A/B diodes once we have a locked PRMI/DRMI. After the gate values opened TJ and I tried to lock the green arms in REFL as we did in 84323 . They didn't stay locked but the periods they were locked were comparable to a normal lock. MICH and PRMI flashes were bad but not terrible. Checked that PRM was within 10urad of last DRMI locked time. So we went to ISCT1 to start aligning the green and PSL ALS path. Green TJ adjusted the upper pericope mirror in PIT and YAW and this improved the alignment both Green X and Y arm cameras and the PSL ALS beam. The beam went though the SHG fine. We added an extra beam-dump after one of the beam-splitters to catch some extra beam scatter. We then touched up the green arms with ETMs/TMSs Ryan C turned on sensor correction and the arms could then locked normally and WFS turned on. Elenna then aligned the beams onto the diode to get the COMM beatnote to get to 0dB. At this point I started looking at the POP alignment and we noticed it was bad so Elenna went to the CR and did input align and MICH alignment with the Guardian and a PRX-by hand. After this Elenna and TJ touched up the beams onto the DIFF beatnote to get to it to -11dB . Checked all beambumps on ALS and green paths. REFL The beam started on the both REFLAIR A and B diodes. TJ then centered the beam on both diodes with their steering mirrors. Partick and the CDS team initialized the new digital REFL camera 84866 and the beam was on it! POP TJ Yaw-ed the top periscope mirror as the beam was clipping the shutter (he then realigned REFL). then I checked that the beam was on all POP optics and touched steering mirrors to by-eye get beam flashes on POPAIR_A/B. We couldn't lock PRMI or see the PRX single bounce beam but could only see flashes on POPAIR_A/B. All beamdumps checked. Once Jenne and Elenna locked DRMI and lowered the ""lockloss"" offsets TJ and I went back to ISCT1 and checked the centering of the beams on POPAIR_A/B both beams were not near edges of diodes.

Only metallic parts were used between the venting port and the bottle (no plastic tubes) and the tube was flushed with Nitrogen beforehand.10:00 - 10:40: The Y+ door has been taken off. The O-rings have been inspected then removed. A human hair was found at 6:30 o'clock and a little piece of white tape was found in the O-ring's groove at 8:00 o'clock and overall the O-rings and grooves were substantially dirty. Pictures about these in the comments. Also the cleanroom was needed to be moved Y+ direction to give enough room for the forklift.10:40 - 11:40: Chamber work. During this time Randy stayed with the forklift so the door was hanging from it all the time and inside the cleanroom.11:45 - 13:30: O-ring installation: it took a few tries but both O-rings were installed nicely. Then installing back the door: smooth process with shoving it in as the last step to avoid the O-rings falling out.13:20 - 13:50: Pumping of the annulus systems and roughing the chamber. The HAM1 side annulus needed ~10 mins to go below the pressure it reached in the last 2 weeks so the troubleshooting was very successful! The roughdown goes well too.16:15 - 16:45: Transitioning to turbo,"{'term': 'LHO VE', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",84875,janos.csizmazia@ligo.org

At this point we upgraded h1omc0 from RCG-5.3.0 to RCG-5.5.0 the new system has code to correct for such receive errors. Erik had the new 5.5.0 boot server ready to go it is h1vmboot5-5 (a new naming scheme). This required the rebuild and restart of all the models on this frontend (h1iopomc0 h1omc h1omcpi). The new RCG added slow channels so a DAQ restart was required for all these models. The builds on RCG-5.5.0 use EJ's new rev-lock system whereby all the source code (mdl and C) must be committed to subversion and only the locked revision of these files are used to build the model not what happens to be in the userapps models directory at the time. This worked like a charm. Later Vicky added some filtermodules to h1omcpi which required a second restart of h1omcpi and the DAQ.

By reducing the communication rate from 16kHz down to 2kHz we were able to ease some of the communication load. This is what l1cdsipscex does - it takes shared memory from l1iscex at 16kHz then sends it to l1asc at a 2kHz data rate.The installation alog is here: 70012 I also included filter banks at the time to add downsampling filters but those apparently went unneeded.

Originally this was closer to the HAM1 Chamber but it was requested to be relocated. To fulfill this our new location has been moved to the Electrical Rack Room by the gowning area of the LVEA. 80 ft PVC Foreline tubing and relocation of the Hicube Station Ion Pump controller for HAM1 Annulus Swapped . Pumping down HAM1 Main Volume . 80 ft PVC Foreline tube routing and relocation of the Hicube Station [Harry Bob JC] We routed an 80 ft PVC foreline from the Electrical Rack Room to the HAM1 Turbopump. This foreline runs through the top cable rack (Currently does not have any cables) into the electrical rack room where the HiCube station is located. The location of the HiCube is positioned away from the DISCONNECT Switches on the inside of the room. From here the foreline runs along the floor by the beam tube all the way to HAM1 while making sure it does not interact with the HEPI Stacks. Ion Pump Controller for HAM1 Annulus Swapped [Bob JC] The original Ion pump controller was nearly railed and redlining. Harry recommended swapping out the Ion pump controller to see if there is any change. After the swap to the new controller for about a minute the current to the Ion pump was ~5-7 mA but afterwards railed and redlined similar to the previous controller. Bob went up to the Ion Pump and gave it a few taps this rattled up the controller a bit but it stayed at it overloaded value >10mA. The swapped controller remains connected and the original Ion pump controller will be tested and double checked by Harry. Most likely will have to swap out the HAM1 annulus Ion pump on a future Maintence tuesday. Pumping down HAM1 Main Volume [Scott Harry Bob JC] After the routing of the PVC Foreline was finished we connected a series of valves to the Turbopump. (Shown in the Attachment below. ) The valve with the pirani gauge is where we will connect the Helium Leak detector in the future this is highlighted in yellow on the attachment below. Highlighted in Blue is the PVC Foreline that is routed to the HiCube Station located in the Electrical Rack Room. Highlighted in Orange is the Turbopump valve which connect the foreline to the HAM1 Main Volume. After connected the Hi Cube station in the Electrical room the station successfully ramped up. Simultaneously we ramped up the HAM1 Turbopump (The two volumes were Isolated from eachother) and once both system were running nominally we connected the two volumes.

The signals can be only weakly co-witnessed by L1:LSC-MICH_IN1_DQ and L1:LSC-PRCL_IN1_DQ as well as the the RF sensors: LSC-POP_A_RF9_I L1:LSC-POP_A_RF45_Q (this is LSC-MICH_IN1) LSC-REFL_A_RF45 ASC-REFL_A_RF9_I_{PITYAW} ASC-REFL_B_RF{945}_YAW (which are all in HAM1). DHARD_P and MICH_P maybe sometimes see the signal weakly but not sure. There was a glitch in at least half of the times that I was able to check which were posted above. The only place other than DARM that this signal is visible is SUS-ITMY_L3_ISCINF_L. This is the MICH_FF and SRCL_FF actuator and this is just witnessing the LSC-MICH_IN1 signal being fed forward.

Never-the-less I failed to find a channel that witnesses the signal any more strongly than DARM and have convinced myself there is no issue with the DARM actuation suspension stage crossovers. Only thing of note about these signals is that they are about 2.5-3 Hz above the BS bounce/roll resonances. These have dampers installed and are notched in the actuation. The signal appears just above the notches. I made changes to the roll bandstop late January [ 75002 ] but the above alog cites incidences before and after this change.

We also see some more relatively persistent transient lines between ~ 700 - 1000 Hz (such ~755 Hz ~784 Hz). Looking at the accelerometer/seismic channels in HAM1 ( 700-800 Hz 800-900 Hz ) and HAM2 we see noisy lines at all these frequencies both at short transients and long transient frequencies. In those seismic channels we see the line features at those frequencies more or less throughout the day but in DARM they show up only sometime. Maybe only sometime they reach some limits (saturations) or maybe we have to look at more channels/locations where the occurance of transients is one-to-one. Some of these features might also be related to similar features reported before the vent (alog 75482 alog 75599 ) where the coupling was expected to come from HAM1/HAM2 regions.

I used the default settings for the 1st and 2nd order modes which worked well albeit slowly. I also decided to damp the 3rd order modes since they had been rung up by the earlier lock loss. The Guardian settings worked for all but the ITMX mode 24 it was ringing up. It's settings were FM4 FM10 and positive gain which I changed to FM3 FM10 and negative gain. The new settings damped the mode well so I saved them in the 3rd order violin Guardian.I had to shut off the 3rd order damping to set the intent bit this was done by 2231 UTC. There are still a few of 3rd order modes that aren't great ITMY mode 22 and ETMX modes 21 and 23 but I didn't have time to try different settings to damp them. They weren't rung up by the 3rd order settings they just didn't damp.Once the damping had brought the modes down to pretty good levels I shut off the 2nd order damping and zeroed the gains on the 1st order ITMY modes around 2343 UTC. The ITMY mode 3 is still not so great but the rest of the modes are looking good.To help damp that mode I used an alternate setting of FM2 FM8 FM10 and negative gain -50 in this case. It is damping but it's very slow I'll watch it a little longer then shut it off before logging off.,"{'term': 'LLO OpsInfo', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",77004,marc.lormand@ligo.org

That's the third time I've noticed that violin modes have been kicked at lock loss due to an earthquake. Other lock losses don't seem to ring them up as badly or at all. Several 1st order modes for all mirrors where rung up enough that they had to be damped before locking the OMC which Vlad did from home. Vlad entered the settings he used for ITMY in the Google spreadsheet.After the IFO advanced past OMC locking the violin Guardian turned on damping but several modes where still high around -15.5 so the Guardian shut off damping to those modes since the threshold is -16.5. Since several modes were still high I paused the violin Guardian so that I could damp the modes while the IFO continued to LOW NOISE. The settings I used to damp the 1st order modes were the default Guardian except lowering or increasing the magnitude of a mode's gain depending on how rung up it was. However for ITMY modes 5 and 6 I made the following changesMode 5 FM1 FM6 FM10 with a negative gainMode 6 FM1 FM3 FM10 with a negative gainI also decided to damp the 2nd order violin modes since all mirrors were rung up and several modes were above the shut off threshold had to pause that Guardian too.The damping took quite some time the ETMY damping is especially slow but by 1944 UTC I was able to un-pause both violin Guardians. I thought that would set the intent bit but I missed the one SDF error that was present. I kept damping the violin modes and at 2104 UTC I turned off the 2nd order damping. That's when I noticed that the bit had not been set so I checked the SDF found the error took a screen shot and then accepted it. So the intent bit wasn't set till about 2105 UTC sorry I missed that.I continued damping the 1st order modes until the IFO lost lock around 2150 UTC. Not sure what brought it down everything looked okay from my home but some storms had passed through earlier so maybe they were moving through LLO. Also it looks like there is an increase in earthquake band seismic noise and there was a 5.9 in the same area south of Australia as yesterday.Included is the screen of the SDF change I accepted it's that same PICO that goes from Disabled to Enabled. ,"{'term': 'LLO OpsInfo', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",77003,marc.lormand@ligo.org

Therefore I resolved mis-wiring in the Beamsplitter model. These models have been checked into the CDS userapps SVN (as r31646): /opt/rtcds/userapps/release/sus/l1/models/ M l1susbs.mdlM l1susfc1.mdlM l1susfc2.mdlM l1susmc1.mdlM l1susmc2.mdlM l1susmc3.mdlM l1suspr2.mdlM l1susprm.mdlM l1sussr2.mdlM l1sussr3.mdlM l1sussrm.mdl All suspension models appear to build at present so I believe SUS is ready for the planned RCG upgrade.

52076,L1 SQZ - -5.2 dB frequency dependent squeezing recovered,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=76988,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 23:07:31 -0500",[Begum Eric Adam TJ Valera] We recovered -5.2 dB frequency dependent squeezing see attached plot for the recovery period starting May 30th see below for the summary of the sqz recovery work. The full recovery efforts will continue in tandem with the thermal changes to the IFO. As mentioned in 76905 the squeezer alignment to the IFO was very off using the pre-break alignment settings. Based on the spot positions on FC refl and FC trans cameras and the FC {GRIR} trans signals the misalingment seems to be mostly due to the ZM{456} mirrors rather than ZM{123} or FC{12}. Finding the 3 MHz beatnote on OMC_TRANS took a significant effort in hand-alignment with the ZM{456} mirrors. After finding the beatnote attempts were made to use the auto-alignment state in SQZ_MANAGER. This resulted in SQZ LO (and subsequently FC) losing lock repeatedly due to low signal amount. After reaching about -2 dB with hand-alignment engaging the SQZ_MANAGER auto align state did actually bring the squeezing to -4 dB. Running the beam walking script (Terminal --> usercode + python sqz/l1/scripts/SCAN_SQZ.py alignment) brought the squeezing level to -4.6 dB. PSAM scans were run last night (Terminal --> usercode + python sqz/l1/scripts/SCAN_SQZ.py PSAMS) to try and improve the mode-matching from SQZ-IFO. Given the thermal state of the IFO not being completely up to the optimal state we expect to keep tuning the squeezer beam parameter for better mode-matching in tandem with the thermal changes to the IFO. Beyond alignment and mode matching the squeezer experienced no real issues during recovery. Notes: There appears to be a point defect on the path after ZM4 which sometimes confuses the SQZ_MANAGER auto-alignment scans near the current alignment. The beam walking script is more resistant to this. There is some hysteresis associated with large changes the the PSAM alignments. FC ASC offload path is currently active on the SQZ_SUS guardian. So far this has created no issues but we need to keep an eye out. FC IR resonances have experienced no changes over the break. The SQZ TTFSS issues experienced early on were simply due to the SQZ laser temperature having to be retuned slightly ( 76795 76826 ). The beat frequency channel issue confused us in the beginning but were resolved shortly after ( 76855 ). Scan results live in /data/SQZ/PSAMS_SCAN /data/SQZ/ALIGN_SCAN and /data/SQZ/GRD/ZM_SCAN directories. Based on the green input power to the OPO pump fiber we think it is a good idea to move the crystal soon after we fully recover squeezing. After this we will need to tune the crystal oven temperature continuously for a month or so. ,"{'term': 'L1 SQZ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",76988,begum.kabagoz@ligo.org

We show the number of glitches in 1 Hz frequency bins between 10 and 30 Hz and the number above the bars indicates the difference in the total number of glitches for that frequency bin. Overall more glitches can be seen in NOLINES than in CALIB-STRAIN. We see a broad peak in NOLINES centered around 20 Hz and a narrower peak centered around 12 Hz. We believe that some of the glitches that were hidden by the calibration lines have moved to higher frequencies and many more glitches have appeared in the calibration line bins. There are no features associated with the 12 and 20 Hz clusters in the glitch histograms (there is a 13.7 Hz quad bounce mode see alog ). This is consistent with frequencies associated with the velocity of scattering surfaces. ,"{'term': 'L1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",76681,rebekah.slocum@ligo.org
