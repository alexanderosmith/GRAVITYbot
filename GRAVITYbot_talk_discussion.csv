(Currently under construction),3634371,Welcome!,5960895,"Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk, @aos11409 jelly_0wen!

Glad to see the summarizer emerging, with capabilities already comparable to a Zooniverse volunteer who has been active for a couple of years and has started to read the logbooks like the daily morning newspapers. (I can confirm from first-hand experience that this is a great way to learn more about the GW observatories.)

Now here's a little challenge: I'd love to see this evolve to the point where it saves me more time than it adds to my workload. :)

I'll post some concrete recommendations / suggestions for improvements / general comments / food for thought in separate threads.

This arrives at an interesting time, with O4c interrupted for maintenance and for some upgrades that have been pulled forward from post-O4: The logbook entries of the next several weeks will talk about rather more drastic changes than tweaking a few sensors, feedback loops, and actuators. For example, whole bunches of new channels will appear when the new active HAM1 ISIs at both LIGO sites are installed and wired up...",,,956549,ZngabitanT,2025-04-03 11:17:18.134000+00:00

Not ""alog"", not ""ALOG"" - by analogy with aLIGO. Use aLOG wherever it appears. (At Virgo, it would be called an *elog*, at KAGRA, a *klog*.)

(2) Make the observatory explicit, and make the number explicit: The hyperlink text should be of the form (e.g.) LLO:75874 .

This ensures that the Search function of Zooniverse Talk will be able to find the occurrence. A number hidden *only* inside the hyperlink URL (as in [the first post I've seen](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/6872/3633195?comment=5960434)) would remain invisible to the Search function.

(3) Gravity Spy volunteers have [expressed a preference](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3493090?comment=5785070&page=2) for having these links open in a new tab, achieved by using markdown like
`[LLO:75874](+tab+https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=75874)`
There has been [some debate elsewhere on Zooniverse](+tab+/talk/17/3531984?comment=5814522) whether or not this is a good idea generally - there are web design guidelines advising against it because it can clutter a novice's browser window with extra tabs, requiring manual action to close them when they're no longer needed. The main advantage in the present scenario is that the viewer doesn't lose the current reading position in the middle of a potentially very long thread.

(It would help if Zoonivese Talk markdown could express the notion of re-using a single additional tab, which it currently can't, or if it had a configurable per-user preference for enabling/disabling this `+tab+` idiom...)

(4) A possible advanced feature: When linking to a comment (like [LLO:75875](+tab+https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=75875)), would it be possible to make this fact explicit, e.g. in the form
`comment [75875](+tab+https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=75875) on LLO:75874`
(the logbook software would always display the whole thread with the linked comment highlighted; the point would be to pre-advise the viewer to scroll down and find the relevant comment)?

(5) Hash signs in hyperlink texts (as in [this summary](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/6872/3633195?comment=5960478)) do not work in Zooniverse Talk. Markdown notation like
`[ALOG Entry #75873](https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=75873)`
will not be recognized as a hyperlink title-cum-URL; the hash sign takes precedence and turns `#75873` into a hashtag search link (which won't work either since the post containing this tag isn't tagging a Zooniverse subject; hashtag searches only look for *subjects*, not for general Talk posts).",,,956549,ZngabitanT,2025-04-03 11:22:46.377000+00:00

The [Abbreviations and acronyms](+tab+https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-M080375/public) document would be a starting point (although it isn't complete, and contains a few mistakes of its own, and the latest version misses a few entries that had been present in earlier versions).

- It makes no sense to refer to ""[the LIGO observatory](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/6872/3633195?comment=5960479)"", singular. Either the plural will be appropriate, or a specific reference to ""LIGO Hanford Observatory"" or ""LIGO Livingston Observatory"".

- ITMY is the Input Test Mass of the Y arm (not ""[Input Test Mass Yaw](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/6872/3633195?comment=5960478)"").

- HEPI is Hydraulic External Pre-Isolation (not ""Horizontal Earthquake Protection Isolator"", *loc.cit.*).

- ALS Y is the Y arm (not ""Yaw"", *loc.cit.*, nor ""[Y-axis](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/6872/3633195?comment=5960434)"") part of the [Arm-Length Stabilization](+tab+https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-G0900215/public) subsystem. (Just to muddy the waters further, at Virgo ALS is the Auxiliary Laser System, although it provides functionality somewhat similar to LIGO's ALS.)

Unfortunately, there are abbreviations which can mean more than one thing depending on context - ""Y"" isn't the only such. (E.g., ""L1"" can mean the Livingston interferometer, or the longitudinal degree of freedom in stage 1 of a quad test mass suspension.) Conversely, there are entities to which people refer with a multitude of different abbreviations. (""X end"", ""X-end"", ""EX"", ""ETMX"" as a metonymy for the end of the X arm, ""EX"" as a metonymy for the ETMX suspension...) Add to this minor spelling variations (""LGV11"" vs. ""LGV-11"",...).

While most everything in the aLOGs may be interesting to at least some members of the intended audience, not everything is *directly* relevant to the Gravity Spy project.

Our focus is on glitches - specifically, on glitches that happen while a LIGO interferometer is locked in nominal low noise state and Observing. Only glitches that happen whilst Observing are eligible for creating Gravity Spy subjects (a few exceptions from the early years notwithstanding).

The Arm Length Stabilization subsystem, for example, is used in a nowadays essential way during lock acquisition... but is switched off before reaching the Observing state. It *won't* ever produce glitch subjects for Gravity Spy.

On a related note, we have some duplication among the summaries posted so far. The logbook software is itself somewhat confusing - repeating entire threads on multiple pages depending on when comments were added to them (or when existing entries were edited). Would the summarizer be able to recognize it when it sees one and the same logbook entry a second time? Would it be able to recognize whether the entry has been edited in the meantime?

This referred to RM1 and RM2. These are mirrors in tip-tilt suspensions, each with several OSEM actuators-cum-feedback-sensors; the photodiodes are those in the OSEMs - they aren't ""photodiodes of cables""; the original sentence was talking about the pins of the connectors of the in-air cables which will carry the current passing through those (in-vacuum) photodiodes.

Pre-Stabilized Laser. Should be in the dictionary. :)

No, far from all of them. The logbook entry was only talking about the handful of beam dumps that had been removed from HAM1. There are hundreds more elsewhere.

> Environmental Scattering Sites at LHO: ...

There's no such thing as Environmental Scattering. What this is about are corners of the vacuum envelope that (unlike the main optics) aren't seismically isolated and thus move relative to the optics in the presence of environmental noise (ground motion), and which are capable of back-reflecting scattered light. Hanford has more of these than Livingston owing to its history of having hosted a second interferometer (H2, with 2 km arms).

> ... including corner retroreflectors ...

Including capped-off nozzles on the extra vacuum chambers (BSC8 is one of those; once upon a time it contained the 45° folding mirror and input test mass of the Y arm of H2) that could *inadvertently* act as corner retroreflectors.",,,956549,ZngabitanT,2025-05-07 08:32:35.047000+00:00

> Proper alignment is crucial for ensuring that the laser beams travel correctly through the interferometer's arms,...

While that is true, it has little to do with the side issue at hand that Anamaria was dealing with. The Interferometer Sensing (and Control) light paths (POP, REFL, ALS X and Y) in HAM1 are being reconstructed from scratch after the [ISI upgrade](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/329/3642584); some of the auxiliary optics are also being upgraded and the light paths have changed a bit; the issue at hand was routing the POP beam (picked off behind PR2 in HAM3 before being sent back along the input arm into HAM1) to where it's going to be needed.

> Realignment of the Periscope: ...

One of several periscopes in the vicinity - the one which catches the POP and ALS beams at the height at which they arrive in HAM1 and brings them down to the level of the small optics on the ISI optical table. It's ""the"" periscope only insofar as those were the beams that people happened to be working on at this point.

Comment 76576 has a picture attached where part of this periscope structure is visible at right; the green beam comes from the Y Arm Length Stabilization (ALS) subsystem:

How would the summarizer have fared? It's a *relatively* recently minted one, although the concept must go back a few years; the first machined and polished examples of the thing would have reached LHO and LLO by mid 2021. To wit:

[LLO:76430](+tab+https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=76430) mentions ""TMDs"", without any further details.

""TMD"" is not in the [Abbreviations and Acronyms List](+tab+https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-M080375/public) - neither in the latest version (v26) nor in older versions.

Trawling for ""TMD"" in the logbooks will find a few mentions... swamped by numerous mentions of ""TMDS"", which is something else entirely (Test Mass Discharge System), totally unrelated to the plural ""TMDs"" of ""TMD"", and not in the Abbreviations and Acronyms either, but I had encountered it earlier.

None of the logbook entries so far that mention the TMDs (plural) have spelled it out yet.

It took me a trawl through the public part of [LIGO DCC](+tab+https://dcc.ligo.org/cgi-bin/DocDB/ListTopics) to find the answer, and even there I found it in a rather obscure place - inside a table summarizing a (separate, non-public) Bill Of Materials listing accompanying a few pages' worth of CAD drawings, embedded in the [PDF](+tab+https://dcc.ligo.org/public/0173/D2100066/001/D2100066-v1_HAM_ISI_Table-A%2B%20-%20.pdf) incarnation of [D2100066 *A+, SEI HAM ISI Table Assembly*](+tab+https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-D2100066/public). Note that neither the acronym nor its expansion can be found by a text search through the PDF. The acronym doesn't occur, only the expansion does, and the lettering is *drawn* in there by the CAD software, so it would need OCR to make it machine-accessible again when there's no human around to simply re-type it.

As of last Wednesday evening, the acronym expansion is now [out](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/329/3642584?comment=6013347) on Gravity Spy talk, so I cannot rule out that the LLM may by now have picked it up from there... :)

LIGO staff sometimes isn't exactly helping. Recent example: a *SLED* is a Superluminous Light-Emitting Diode, used in Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensing. A *sled*, on the other hand, is not an acronym - it's a small breadboard for mounting optical components rigidly with respect to each other before bolting the whole onto a larger optical table, at which time the sled's position along with that of its entire payload can be adjusted with respect to the table.

---
A few other remarks (numbers will match up with the above post):

1. Not every moniker tossed up in Gravity Spy Talk constitutes a ""New Glitch Classes Proposed This Week"". Most don't! People keep rediscovering things and giving them new names. People even keep forgetting their own earlier proposed nicknames, and come up with new ones for one and the same phenomenon. People can be more eager to talk about one-of-a-kind rarities than about stuff that's been coming up time and again.

For good reasons, the DetChar team has established guidelines for what constitutes a glitch *class*. Glitch populations with fewer than 75 known individuals need not apply. And formal proposals need to adhere to a specific format and are limited to the New Glitch Classes boards, and these are writable only by moderators and other team members. It takes at least six to eight solid weeks to write up even one proposal, more if other stuff needs attention in the meantime. And (fortunately) new glitch classes don't arise every week.

If we really want to draw attention to something new that's been spotted among freshly uploaded subjects (once uploads resume after the current maintenance break - we're still missing three weeks' worth from *before* the break and I haven't heard back from Mike Zevin in a while), we would explicitly tag the \@researchers, and I would use [a dedicated thread](+tab+https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/2961842) in the *New Glitch Classes - LIGO* board for the purpose.

The ""[rain clouds](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3677083)"" do stand out as a population of eminently recognizable glitches. As things look at the moment, however, they won't make the ""75 examples"" cut before O4 ends. They may end up being summarized as an also-ran in a thread in the Collections board (once someone or myself gets round to doing the legwork).

2. Many day-to-day discussions or Q&A in comments on individual subjects aren't ""Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes"" - they are just what they are, discussions (of something that a novice volunteer is just noticing, or of possible outliers or borderline cases), or questions and answers about where a particular subject might belong.

The comment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3681387 in no way represents a ""[concern] about the ""Fuzzy"" glitch classification"", nor a ""discussions on whether new observations fit this class"", nor an ""ongoing ambiguity in defining the boundaries of the ""Fuzzy"" class."" It's just one experienced volunteer highlighting one more definite member of the proposed class, for the benefit of others (like me) who are curating our own lists/collections, and who can use a *succession* of such comments (not any single one!) to extrapolate how many more subjects exist in the population that haven't been seen yet.

3. There haven't been any emerging
> questions about the ""needle eye sunglasses"" glitch classification

...only one comment by one veteran volunteer tagging one subject as ""\#needle_eye"", followed by a sunglasses emoji ""B-)"" to convey that it's a cool find!

4. There have been no ""[d]iscussions around glitches observed during beam alignment and profiling activities provide insights into how specific maintenance and calibration tasks at LIGO can influence data quality, leading to transient glitches.""

Not everything posted to Gravity Spy Talk is a ""discussion around glitches""!

Rather, the linked [thread](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/329/3642584) is an early part of an effort of my own to summarize ongoing *upgrades* towards the future O5 configuration and capabilities, in this case about work pulled forward into the mid-O4c maintenance break since sufficient time and all required ingredients were already available.

During the months leading up to O4 in early 2023, while we were all eagerly waiting for the first new subjects to arrive, I had already posted a [series](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/330/2800503?comment=4627671) of similar education-and-public-outreach threads. People enjoy the occasional look behind the scenes, they relish [inside views](+tab+https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/uploads/61276_20220830105529_IMG_20220829_152213.jpg) of the hardware from angles they'd never be allowed to enter themselves even during a guided site visit, and they love the occasional human angle - or [little furry angle](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/329/2832683)!

This doesn't have much to do with glitches. It's about taking pride in what humans have been able to achieve, and about the joy of being a small part of it.

5. It is a well-known fact (and not an ""emerging concern"") that not all glitch populations are common to Hanford and Livingston. There are some differences in the hardware setups. There are differences in the software running the sensing and control loops. There are procedural differences, and cultural differences in logbook-writing habits. There are signficiant environmental differences - Hanford gets lots more wind especially during the colder season, while Livingston has to contend with microseism from wind-driven ocean activity in the Caribbean and with anthropogenic noise from seasonal timber logging and occasional freight trains on the Baton Rouge - Hammond line. And small things will, from time to time, act up on their own, individually at each site - one loose signal cable connection at Livingston is not going to produce glitches at Hanford.

For a novice Gravity Spy volunteer, these may be emerging *insights* after a few weeks or months. But - once again - I wouldn't use the word ""concern"" in such contexts. If I am concerned, it's about other things - the future of research funding, the future of the people engaged in research, and on more modest scales, the flow of our subjects hopefully resuming soon, some long-standing bugs in the Gravity Spy tools hopefully being addressed at some point, our community on Zooniverse hopefully continuing to thrive. May the GS Machine Learning and the DetChar team keep benefitting from our contributions!",,,956549,ZngabitanT,2025-05-25 13:20:46.597000+00:00

> that the summarizer really struggles with understanding when two things are the same context if the language surrounding them appears significantly different.

I'm inclined to summarize this as: LLMs struggle with understanding, period. B-)

They emulate a part of what Daniel Kahneman calls ""system I"", the part of cognition that works fast with a minimum effort, involved in rapidly dealing with familiar everyday situations, small talk, prejudices, jumping to conclusions, and all that. LLMs do not at the present time emulate ""system II"" cognition - thinking slow, carefully, conceptually, consciously taking one's own preconceptions into account and keeping track of what I know, what I think I know but lack evidence for, what I don't know and need to find out in order to figure something out, and so on (in other words, everything I need, day in day out on my day job for many years, whilst troubleshooting complex non-AI software platforms).

It has long been known (from studying patients with partial brain injuries), and it is more recently being borne out by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), that many cognitive capabilities are handled by parts of the brain *other than* those handling language processing and language production, spoken or written.

If you have access to a library that still stocks the dead-tree sort of material on things called ""shelves"" :), I'll recommend a look at
*Brouwer vindicated by neuroscience* by Victor Pambuccian, published as the *Viewpoint* column in The Mathematical Intelligencer, vol.47 no.1, spring 2025, p.2-5,
itself a concise summary of a longer article. (A background in mathematical logic is *not* required.)

One source it draws on and quotes from is
*Language is primarily a tool for communication rather than thought.* by E. Fedorenko, S.T. Piantadosi, and E.A.F. Gibson, Nature 630 (2024), 575-586.

> ...fMRI evidence suggsts that engaging in diverse forms of thinking and
reasoning does not recruit the language network - a set of brain areas
that represent and process word meanings and syntactic structure during
language comprehension and production. (p.582)
> Instead of providing the key substrate for thinking and reasoning,
language likely transformed our species by enabling cross-generational
transmission of acquired knowledge. (p.583.)

Dear Gravity Spy lovers, esteemed co-volunteers: The research team is presenting us with a new machine learning baby, of a new type, not like the glitch-image-classifying ML we're familiar with, but one that's powered by a trendy Large Language Model (LLM).

All of you who have occasionally or frequently consulted the LIGO logbooks and tried to make sense of the sometimes arcane utterances of the engineers and operators will know that they can be hard to fathom at first, and the LLM isn't finding it much easier. Just like the old Gravity Spy ML, which will continue to chug along and label glitches as it sees fit according to its past training, the new GRAVITYbot ML will need our help.

So for now, just a few remarks concerning the summary I'm replying to:

- RM *can* mean ""reaction mass"", but in the context of [LHO:84569](+tab+https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84569) it refers to the two steerable suspended mirrors (M) in the REFL (R) light path, RM1 and RM2, that have recently been reinstalled on the input end of the interferometer after the [ISI upgrade in that vacuum chamber](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/329/3642584).
- MICH refers to the ""Michelson parameter"" - the precise location of the central Beam Splitter relative to the input test masses of the two arms. ""MICH gain"" is the amplification factor of the feedback control loop which serves to maintain this precise location so as to have destructive interference towards the output side (and constructive interference on the input side, towards the Power Recycling Mirror). When the gain is too low, control won't be sufficiently accurate; when it is too high, the feedback loop may start to oscillate.
- ""Flow"" in the context of the Thermal Compensation System refers to the fluid chiller circuits for the TCS's CO~2~ lasers and their controller electronics.
The troubleshooting report in [LHO:84563](+tab+https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84563) ended with ""*For now, sorry Crab Nebula.*"" - an oblique reference to [another logbook discussion thread from a few months ago](+tab+https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=81246) when the chiller flow had been reduced in order to reduce noise near 59.7 Hz where astrophysicists have been looking for continuous, very weak, gravitational waves from the [Crab pulsar](+tab+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_Pulsar).",,,956549,ZngabitanT,2025-05-28 07:55:43.106000+00:00

I don't intend to personally follow up to each and every one with comments / clarifications / corrections, but anyone who's interested will be welcome to double-check the summaries against the sources. :)

There are several areas where the Large Language Model has been struggling during earlier testing:
- The logbooks make heavy use of acronyms, and not always does the LLM get their expansions straight. (It doesn't help that one and the same sequence of letters might also occur as an ordinary word - e.g. *sled* vs SLED (superluminous light-emitting diode) - nor that some acronyms end in an S while others might take a plural s, e.g. a TMDS is one thing while TMDs, coming in threes, are very different things - nor that one and the same acronym can have different expansions in different contexts, e.g. IP can mean any of *ion pump*, *inverted pendulum*, *internet protocol*, or *intellectual property*).
- Lots of things have names consisting of an acronym and a number, like PR2, the second mirror in the Power Recycling cavity. During testing the LLM has often been dropping the numbers in such cases, keeping only the letters.
- Likewise, measurements and other quantities appear in the logbook entries in number-and-unit combinations like ""1600.1 Hz"", and the LLM is more interested in the letters than the numbers - it may keep only the ""Hz"".
- Authors of logbook entries aren't always fully explicit, referring obliquely to things they assume readers would already know. (For example, the word *Rattlesnake* in [LHO:84685](+tab+https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84685) refers to a *mountain* on Hanford's horizon, *not* to a reptile.)
- Logbook entries are often written by tired people at the end of a long shift... and tired people sometimes make typos or other mistakes. Reading between the lines to figure out what was intended is still something we humans are better at. :)",,,956549,ZngabitanT,2025-06-01 11:50:18.548000+00:00

Először is szeretnék gratulálni ehhez a fantasztikus fejlesztéshez! A GRAVITYbot projekt valóban innovatív megközelítés, és látható, hogy komoly munkát fektettek bele. Köszönöm a nyílt kommunikációt és azt, hogy bevonják a közösséget a fejlesztési folyamatba.

Rengeteg kérdésem lett volna ezért elsőnek próbáltam utána járni, hogy ne terheljem önöket felesleges kérdésekkel. 

Több mint 5+ éves tapasztalattal rendelkező Gravity Spy önkéntes, szeretnék néhány kérdést feltenni, amelyek segíthetnének jobban megérteni az új lehetőségeket:

Gyakorlati munkavégzés és felhasználói élmény

ZngabitanT, mivel Ön már teszteli a rendszert, szeretném megkérdezni:

Hogyan változott meg a napi munkavégzése? Milyen új interface elemekkel találkozott?

Mennyivel több időt vesz igénybe egy feladat a hagyományos spektrogram osztályozáshoz képest?

Vannak-e olyan funkciók, amelyeket különösen hasznosnak talál?

jelly_0wen, mint a projekt vezetője:

Terveznek-e részletes felhasználói útmutatót vagy képzési anyagokat a LIGO terminológiához? Ez véleményem szerint rendkívül hasznos lenne,de ha jól értem mi fogjuk a kezdetekben tanitani a GRAVITYbot. 

Hogyan biztosítják, hogy a tapasztalt önkéntesek zökkenőmentesen át tudjanak állni az új rendszerre?

Hozzáférés és közösségi integráció

Tisztelt Kutatók, szeretném tudni:

Mikor várható, hogy a tapasztalt önkéntesek hozzáférést kapnak a beta verzióhoz? Vagy ez egyidejűleg mindenkinek rendelkezésére fog állni? 

Hogyan alakul át a jelenlegi háromszintű (beginner/intermediate/advanced) rendszer?

Milyen szerepet szánnának nekünk, veterán önkénteseknek az új tagok mentorálásában?

Technikai megbízhatóság és visszajelzés

jelly_0wen, értékelnénk, ha elmondaná:

Milyen mechanizmusok vannak az AI hibák jelentésére és javítására?

Hogyan használják fel a GitHub repository-n keresztül érkező közösségi visszajelzéseket?

Van-e tervezett timeline a stabil verzió eléréséhez?

Jövőbeli vízió és fejlesztési irányok

ZngabitanT tapasztalatai alapján és jelly_0wen fejlesztési stratégiája szerint:

Ez az automatizált összefoglaló szolgáltatás előkészítője egy interaktív AI partnernek?

Hogyan illeszkedik ez a hosszú távú Gravity Spy 2.0 víziójába?

Milyen további integrációkat terveznek más LIGO eszközökkel?

Elismerés és motiváció

Végül, szeretnénk tudni:

Hogyan biztosítják, hogy a közösség motivált maradjon az új kihívások mellett?

Változik-e valami a publikációkban való elismerés terén?

Láthatjuk-e majd konkrétan, hogy munkánk hogyan járul hozzá a tudományos eredményekhez?

Ismét köszönöm mindkettőjüknek ezt a lenyűgöző projektet és a közösség bevonását. Izgatottan várjuk a további fejleményeket!

Tisztelettel,
Egy lelkes Gravity Spy önkéntes

P.S.: A nyílt forráskódú megközelítés különösen értékes - ez valóban példaértékű a citizen science projektekben!

",6052749,"Hi,

Thank you  jelly_0wen @aos11409 for providing more information about this project. It is an interesting development to help better comprehend log entries and activities, difficult to grasp outside the lab environment.

I have compared the bot summary in this thread with the corresponding log entries. I do not know how general or detailed the summaries are expected to be. Hence, I cannot asses the relevance of the bot’s omittance of certain log entry content. I presume, though, that a broad overview of events is the target.

## **Feedback**

It is good to have sections for different topics or areas. Overall, it looks coherent and uses clear language. While I did not find important errors, I am adding a couple of observations and notes below.

### **Acronym and Initialism Full Text**

Regarding:

 1. WFS Centering Saturating Reaction Masses (RMs): There was a problem with the Wavefront Sensor (WFS) centering that caused saturation in the reaction masses. This issue was discovered when the input matrix values were found to be flipped, misaligning the responses and causing abnormal behavior. The flipping was corrected, but careful monitoring is advised to ensure stability.

    - [See the conversation here for more details.](https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84569)

The initialism “WFS” needs to be written in full text before the colon. Expand once introducing the term, then use just the acronym or initialism.

### **Acronyms and Initialisms as Verbs**

In the first [log entry](+tab+https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84569) referenced in this bot summary, acronyms (or initialisms in this case) are seemingly used as verbs in the following sentence (not included in the summary):

> However, it appears this was never SDFed, and got reverted.

To digest the lab lingo into summaries easier to understand, a verb would be helpful if such instances are to be described (provided the model has been trained enough to find such relevance). I presume that the missing verb here relates to the SDF software.

### **Wording**

In the second paragraph in this bot summary, nested  bullet:

- [See the detailed lock acquisition process here.](https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84570)

Though subtle, for term accuracy following the log descriptions, it would be either “relock acquisition” or “lock reacquisition”.

### **Manual of Style**

Does the bot follow any particular manual of style?. The paragraph formatting looks odd. For instance, a single paragraph as a numbered list and numbered lists for non-sequential paragraphs.

If it does follow a manual of style, it would be useful to know which one.

### **Possible Future Chatbots**

In my opinion, depending on the feasibility of the chatbots mentioned in the referenced GitHub page, it would be desirable if a chatbot would help to narrow down the retrieval of information across the forum, which can be time-consuming with the limited Zooniverse search capabilities (I have not found a workaround with search operators).

For example, a query about specific terms mentioned by a particular user in a given time range or about a glitch class mentioned in a certain time range while omitting tags, could return a list of relevant post links. 

Thank you.

and if the text is not as we want it to be, I recommend that have a manual procedure on how the template text should be summarized for him.
and about what I can find out from his technical structural origin.
[ZngabitanT's comment](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/6945/3686103?comment=6047779) :
> Likewise, measurements and other quantities appear in the logbook entries in number-and-unit combinations like ""1600.1 Hz"", and the LLM is more interested in the letters than the numbers - it may keep only the ""Hz"".

This is a common phenomenon when for a [Attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_(machine_learning)) reasons a string pattern not normally seen is ignored as noise, a behavior that is often ignored due to stabilization ([regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics))) during LLM's training. Want to draw attention to this? How the training set should be or how the text data is given as context determines character of his bot.
for those who deal with LLM's, it may be good to consider it a great success just to have the text output, because if a human needs prerequisite knowledge to decipher it, it may often miss the mark if expected, we can believe that it is important to gradually make the task more difficult through every incremental step. :)",,,2395765,Nicm25,2025-06-05 14:09:00.638000+00:00

",6053940,"Dear ZngabitanT and jelly_0wen!

First of all, I would like to congratulate you on this fantastic development! The GRAVITYbot project is truly an innovative approach, and it's evident that you've put serious work into it. Thank you for the open communication and for involving the community in the development process.

I had numerous questions, so I first tried to research them myself to avoid burdening you with unnecessary inquiries.

As a Gravity Spy volunteer with more than 5 years of experience, I would like to ask a few questions to help me better understand the new opportunities:

Practical Workflow and User Experience
ZngabitanT, since you are already testing the system, I would like to ask:

How has your daily workflow changed? What new interface elements have you encountered?

How much more time does a task take compared to traditional spectrogram classification?

Are there any features that you find particularly useful?

jelly_0wen, as the project leader:

Are you planning detailed user guides or training materials for LIGO terminology? This would be extremely useful in my opinion, but if I understand correctly, we will be teaching GRAVITYbot in the beginning stages.

How do you ensure that experienced volunteers can seamlessly transition to the new system?

Access and Community Integration
Dear Researchers, I would like to know:

When can experienced volunteers expect to gain access to the beta version? Or will this be available to everyone simultaneously?

How will the current three-tier system (beginner/intermediate/advanced) be transformed?

What role do we, veteran volunteers, play in mentoring new members?

Technical Reliability and Feedback
jelly_0wen, we would appreciate if you could tell us:

What mechanisms are in place for reporting and correcting AI errors?

How do we use community feedback through the GitHub repository?

Is there a planned timeline for reaching a stable version?

Future Vision and Development Directions
Based on ZngabitanT's experience and jelly_0wen's development strategy:

Is this automated summary feature a precursor to an interactive AI partner?

How does this fit into the long-planned Gravity Spy 2.0 vision?

What additional integrations are planned with other LIGO tools?

Recognition and Motivation
Finally, we need to know:

How do you ensure that the community remains motivated alongside the new challenges?

Will anything change regarding recognition in publications?

Will we be able to see concretely how our work contributes to scientific results?

Again, thank you both for this excellent project and for involving the community. We are excitedly awaiting further developments!

Respectfully,
An enthusiastic Gravity Spy volunteer

- Some links do not seem to target a relevant thread.

Thank you @Coralbell for your observations!

1. While it's nice to see a number followed by a unit, the ""fuzzy range"" noise at Hanford is *not* ""characterized by noise mostly at 50Hz and its multiples"" (nor any other specific frequencies) - in contrast to Livingston's similar-looking glitches from mid July 2024 which *did* have much noise at *62* Hz and multiples thereof. Also, there have been *three* (so far) ""fuzzy range"" episodes at Hanford, and they're hardly ""novel"". (The moniker had been coined back in November 2023 by one LHO operator in [LHO:74383](+tab+https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=74383), and had caught on quickly there, cf. [LHO:74387](+tab+https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=74383) and the data quality shift report 2023-11-20 to 2023-11-26 [LHO:74437](+tab+https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=74437).)

2. This is indeed a mix-up of thread references. Blends of blips with curving features somewhat reminiscent of chirps *had* been mentioned elsewhere a couple of weeks ago, apropos of [Subject 98584876](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3686024) and of [Subject 107350522](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3686027).

3. [Beam Jitter](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3438785) has been *known* since the early weeks of O4a to be one cause of glitches  - there's nothing ""emerging"" or ""hypothesized"" about it.

Re 4. and 5., GRAVITYbot has been instructed not to summarize *its own* postings to Gravity Spy Talk on Zooniverse, but here it got misled by two posts that had been forwarded by its trainer. :)

Regarding:

> As of yet, the bot does not follow any manual of style. Initially, the LLM model decided the structure for itself, which admittedly could use improvement. This is a particular interest that I had planned on asking about. Is there a preference for a style guide? I am in the process of reformatting the prompts, and I would happily look into a more standardized structure if it increases readability.

From my experience as a technical writer in American English at a software company, the following are fine resources: William Strunk's *The Elements of Style* for solid writing foundations in a concise book and the Chicago Manual of Style (CMS) for comprehensive usage and styling. 

In my opinion, Strunk’s guide contains in a nutshell all what is needed to write correctly; there are newer editions expanded. For extensive style formatting aspects, the CMS is detailed and widely used along other respectable manuals of style.

Thank you.

- As discussed behind the scenes before, it would be much more useful if the clickable link texts of the logbook hyperlinks *always and consistently* followed the convention
`[LHO:84922](+tab+https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84922)`
instead of
`[Beam Splitter Issue](https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84922)`
(and similarly for LLO logbook links). The main reason is that having the entry number in the link text (not only in the URL) makes it visible to the Zooniverse Talk function: Participants who have stumbled upon a logbook entry e.g. in the course of looking at all entries from a certain date would then be able to search for the entry number here in Gravity Spy Talk and would be able to find a discussion of the entry if one exists.
Merely repeating words like ""Beam Splitter Issue"" in the link text adds no value.
Like the `+tab+` idiom and the byline, this is something that I would *not* leave to the LLM to get right - I'd hardwire it in a wrapper script that polishes the summary just before posting.

- ""Green Reference"" in [LHO:84902](+tab+https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84902) is an oblique reference to the Arm-Length Stabilization (ALS) subsystem. And it weren't the green *lasers* that were reset - what was reset were the reference points of the ALS alignment sensors (cameras, quadrant photodiodes and wavefront sensors).
Also, ALS issues won't ""introduce errors in calibrations"". (They might introduce lost time and operator headaches while trying to reacquire a lost lock...)

- *No* ""[a]djustments were made to the Optical Mode Cleaner (OMC) phase rotation settings"" at the present time! The linked logbook entry [LHO:84933](+tab+https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84933) is a comment on an entry from January 2025. Commissioners and the operator on duty were merely checking up a bit of history while working on the post-maintenance-break calibration, and saw fit to add a clarifying remark and a plot to the older entry.

- ""An earthquake occurred"".... many earthquakes occur every day on our restless planet. The Picket Fence isn't a ""device"" - it's a selected group from among the network of USGS (and Canadian) seismic monitoring stations, located in all directions as seen from Hanford, and each sufficiently far away to provide advance warning about incoming seismic waves in time to transition the seismic isolations and suspensions to earthquake mode in case of a major event.
The specific earthquake that prompted this logbook entry [LHO:84975](+tab+https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=84975) got [identified](+tab+https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us6000qjm5/) in a subsequent comment.",,,956549,ZngabitanT,2025-06-15 16:10:59.653000+00:00

- The F1 OSEM issue (affecting the top stage of the ITMX quad suspension) was addressed and fixed the same day. It was not so much affecting ""the stability and accuracy of gravitational wave data measurements"" as causing outright locklosses, both from Observing and at late stages of lock acquisition while the input laser power is being ramped up. [LLO:77097](+tab+https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=77097) is a bit more explicit about this than the cited [LLO:77089](+tab+https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=77089).

- It's not *the* ITMY ADC card, but *an* ADC card (one of several which convert analog signals from the IMTY HEPI to digital), as [LLO:77064](+tab+https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=77064) had correctly stated.
But this isn't even the logbook entry that *should* have been referenced - it's just the operator's abbreviated summary of what was going on. The relevant logbook entry is [LLO:77058](+tab+https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=77058) along with its comments.

- A turbomolecular pump isn't a ""sensor"", nor is its controller (electronics box). What [LLO:77091](+tab+https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=77091) really was about was putting the controller on vibration-damping Viton pads.
Crucial context is missing here - that a turbomolecular pump is allowed to be running *at all* whilst observing is just because pumpdown of the HAM1 chamber after the long [upgrade incursion](+tab+/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/329/3642584) isn't quite complete yet. As soon as the pressure has come down enough for the ion pumps to hold it down on their own, the TMP will be valved out and turned off.

- HEPI is Hydraulic External Pre-Isolation. Not ""horizontal"", not ""earthquake"", nor ""protection"". It wasn't ""adjusted""; and once again, the mid-shift report [LLO:77070](+tab+https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=77070) is a secondary source - echoing the same primary story [LLO:77058](+tab+https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=77058) as above.
